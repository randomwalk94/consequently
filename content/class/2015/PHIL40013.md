**<span class="caps">PHIL40013</span>: Uncertainty, Vagueness and Paradox** is a [University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au) honours seminar subject for fourth-year students. Our aim in the Honours program is to introduce students to current work in research in Philosophy. In 2015, I will cover some topic introducing logic and its applications to issues in metaphysics, epistemology or philosophy of language. For further information, contact me. To participate, check [the handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2015/PHIL40013).
