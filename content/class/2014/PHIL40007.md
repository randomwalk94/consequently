**PHIL40007: Philosophy of Language and Mind** is a [University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au) honours seminar subject for fourth-year students. Our aim in the Honours program is to introduce students to current work in research in Philosophy. In 2014, I introduced the students to the normative pragmatism and inferentialism of Robert Brandom, through a close reading of his book [*Articulating Reasons*](http://www.amazon.com/Articulating-Reasons-An-Introduction-Inferentialism/dp/0674006925/consequentlyorg) and related literature.
