**UNIB10002: Logic, Language and Information** is a [University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au) undergraduate breadth subject, introducing logic and its applications to students from a broad range of disciplines in the Arts, Sciences and Engineering. I coordinate this subject with my colleague Dr. Jen Davoren, with help from Dr. Lesley Stirling and Dr. Peter Schachte. 

The subject was taught to University of Melbourne undergraduate students. Details for enrolment are [here](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2014/UNIB10002). We teach this in a &lsquo;flipped classroom&rsquo; model, using resources from our Coursera subjects [Logic 1](/class/2014/logic1_coursera) and [Logic 2](/class/2014/logic2_coursera).
