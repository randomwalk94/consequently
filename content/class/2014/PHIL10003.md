**PHIL10003: Philosophy, the Great Thinkers** is a [University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au) undergraduate subject, introducing philosophy to students through close readings of core texts. I taught with Dr. Chris Cordner and Dr. Ruth Boeker. In my classes, we looked at David Hume&rsquo; [*Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion*](http://davidhume.org/texts/dnr.html) and [*Natural History of Religion*](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92n/contents.html), with some side trips into hume's [*Enquiry*](http://davidhume.org/texts/ehu.html), and some Marx, Wittgenstein for good measure.

The subject was taught to University of Melbourne undergraduate students (for Arts students as a part of the Philosophy major, for non-Arts students, as a breadth subject). Details for enrolment are [here](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2014/PHIL10003).
