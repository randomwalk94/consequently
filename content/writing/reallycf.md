I show that any finitely valued logic of a simple kind fails to support na&iuml;ve comprehension, if it has a conditional. I then go on to show how some infinitely valued logics also fail to be _robustly contraction free_. Then I make a bold conjecture that robust contraction freedom is sufficient to support na&iuml;ve set theory. This conjecture was later proved to be wrong by two graduate students from Monash, Sam Buchart and Su Rogerson, in some delightful work in 1997, which has since also been published in _Studia Logica_.
