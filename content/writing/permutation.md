This note explains an error in Restall's 'Simplified Semantics for Relevant Logics (and some of their rivals)' (<em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em> 1993) concerning the modelling conditions for the axioms of <em>assertion</em> <em>A</em> &rarr; ((<em>A</em> &rarr; <em>B</em>) &rarr; <em>B</em>)  and <em>permutation</em> (<em>A</em> &rarr; (<em>B</em> &rarr; <em>C</em>)) &rarr; (<em>B</em> &rarr; (<em>A</em> &rarr; <em>C</em>)).  We show that the modelling conditions for assertion and permutation proposed in 'Simplified Semantics' overgenerate. In fact, they overgenerate so badly that the proposed semantics for the relevant logic R validate the rule of disjunctive syllogism.  The semantics provides for <em>no</em> models of R in which the "base point" is inconsistent.

In this note, we explain this result, diagnose the mistake in 'Simplified Semantics' and propose a correction.
