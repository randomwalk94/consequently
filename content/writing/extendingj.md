Ideas on the extension of intuitionistic propositional and predicate logic with a 'subtraction' connective, Galois connected with disjunction, dual to the implication connective, Galois connected with conjunction. Presented to an audience at Victoria University of Wellington, July 1997. I like this material, but it does not contain any ideas not accessible elsewhere, so it won't be published anywhere other than here.
