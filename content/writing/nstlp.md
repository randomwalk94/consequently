My first publication. It stems from work I did in my Honours year (1989) with Graham Priest, on paraconsistent logic. I explain a particularly simple yet powerful technique for constructing models of na√Øve set theory in the paraconsistent logic **LP**. This can be used to show the consistency of the theory, and to construct models invalidating some of the axioms of ZFC.
