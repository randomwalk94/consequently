In his paper &ldquo;Generalised Ortho Negation&rdquo; J. Michael Dunn mentions a claim of mine to the effect that there is no condition on `perp frames' equivalent to the holding of <em>double negation elimination</em> (from ~~A to infer A). That claim of mine was wrong. In this paper I correct my error and analyse the behaviour of conditions on frames for negations which verify a number of different theses. (<a href="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/phil/ed.html">Ed Mares</a> has pointed out that there&rsquo;s some overlap between this paper and his earlier &ldquo;A Star-Free Semantics for R&rdquo; (JSL 1995), which I'd read long before writing this one. The particular modelling condition for DNE is still original to me, however.)
