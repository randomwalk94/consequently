We argue that the participatory language, used in the New Testament to describe the the efficacy of Jesus' death on the cross, is essential for any understanding of the atonement. Purely personal or legal metaphors are incomplete and perhaps misleading on their own. They make much more sense when combined with and undergirded by, participatory metaphors.
