In this paper I consider an interpretation of future contingents which motivates a unification of a &#321;ukasiewicz style logic with the more classical supervaluational semantics.  This in turn motivates a new non-classical logic modelling what is "made true by history up until now."  I give a simple Hilbert-style proof theory, and a soundness and completeness argument for the proof theory with respect to the intended models.
