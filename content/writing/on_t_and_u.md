This paper shows that once we have propositional constants <em>t</em> (the conjunction of all truths) and <em>u</em> (the disjunction of all untruths), paradox ensues, provided you have a conditional in the language strong enough to give you <em>modus ponens</em>.  This is an issue for views like those of Jc Beall, Ross Brady, Hartry Field and Graham Priest.
