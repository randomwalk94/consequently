There is widespread agreement that the law of non-contradiction is an important logical principle. There is less agreement on exactly <em>what</em> the law amounts to. This unclarity is brought to light by the emergence of paraconsistent logics in which contradictions are tolerated (in the sense that not everything need follow from a contradiction, and that there are "worlds" in which contradictions are true) but in which the statement ~(_A_ &amp; ~_A_) (it is not the case that _A_ and not-_A_) is still provable. This paper attempts to clarify the connection between different readings of the law of non-contradiction, the duality between the law of non-contradiction and the law of the excluded middle, and connections with logical consequence in general.
