Stephen Read has recently discussed Thomas Bradwardine's theory of truth, and defended it as an appropriate way to treat paradoxes such as the liar. In this paper, I discuss Read's formalisation of Bradwardine's theory of truth, and provide a class of models for this theory.  The models facilitate comparison of Bradwardine's theory with contemporary theories of truth.
