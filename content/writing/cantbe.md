I show that the believer in possible worlds can have <em>impossible worlds</em> for free, as classes of possible worlds. These do exactly the job of ways that things <em>cannot</em> be, and they model the simple paraconsistent logic LP. This motivates a semantics for paraconsistent logic that even a classical logician can love.
