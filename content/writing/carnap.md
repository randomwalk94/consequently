In this paper, I distinguish different kinds of pluralism about logical consequence. In particular, I distinguish the pluralism about logic arising from Carnap's <em>Principle of Tolerance</em> from a pluralism which maintains that there are different, equally "good" logical consequence relations on the one language. I will argue that this second form of pluralism does more justice to the contemporary state of logical theory and practice than does Carnap&rsquo;s more moderate pluralism.
