This is our article on <em>logical pluralism</em>.  We argue that the notion of logical consequence doesn't pin down <em>one</em> deductive consequence relation, but rather, there are many of them.  In particular, we argue that broadly classical, intuitionistic and relevant accounts of deductive logic are genuine logical consequence relations.  We should not search for <em>One True Logic</em>, since there are <em>Many</em>.

A bigger version of the argument (with much more detail) is found in our <em><a href="http://consequently.org/writing/pluralism">book</a></em> of the same name.
