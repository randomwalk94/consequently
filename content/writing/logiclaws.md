This is an introductory essay on the notion of a &ldquo;Logical Law.&rdquo; In it, I show that there are three important different questions one can ask about logical laws. Firstly, what it <em>means</em> to be a logical law. Secondly, what <em>makes</em> something a logical law, and thirdly, what <em>are</em> the logical laws. Each of these questions are answered differently by different people. I sketch the important differences in views, and point the way ahead for logical research.
