Mark Balaguer has, in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195143981/ref=nosim/consequentlyorg">Platonism and Anti-Platonism in Mathematics</a></em>, given us an intriguing new brand of platonism, which he calls, plenitudinous platonism, or more colourfully, <em>full-blooded platonism.</em> In this paper, I argue that none of Balaguer&rsquo;s attempts to characterise full-blooded platonism succeed. They are either too strong, with untoward consequences we all reject, or too weak, not providing a distinctive brand of platonism strong enough to do the work Balaguer requires of it.
