Published in a special issue of <em>Logique et Analyse</em>,  on Truthmakers, edited by <a href="http://www.une.edu.au/~arts/Philosop/pforrest.htm">Peter Forrest</a> and <a href="http://www.une.edu.au/~arts/Philosop/dkhlentzos.htm">Drew Khlentzos</a>.  This expands on my paper &ldquo;Truthmakers, Entailment and Necessity" by showing that the theses on truthmaking given in that paper are mutually consistent. It does this by providing a model in which each thesis is true. This model is an independently motivated model of a weak quantified relevant logic with an existence predicate.
