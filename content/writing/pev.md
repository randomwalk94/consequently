Paraconsistent logics are, by definition, <em>inconsistency
tolerant</em>:  In a paraconsistent logic, inconsistencies need not
entail everything.  However, there is more than one way a body 
of information can be inconsistent.  In this paper I distinguish 
contradictions from other inconsistencies, and I show that 
several different logics are, in an important sense, "paraconsistent" 
in virtue of being <em>inconsistency tolerant</em> without thereby 
being <em>contradiction tolerant</em>.  For example, even though no 
inconsistencies are tolerated by intuitionistic <em>propositional</em>
logic, some inconsistencies are tolerated by intuitionistic 
<em>predicate</em> logic.  In this way, intuitionistic predicate logic 
is, in a mild sense, paraconsistent.  So too are orthologic and quantum 
propositional logic and other formal systems.  Given this fact, a 
widespread view that traditional paraconsistent logics are especially 
repugnant because they countenance inconsistencies is undercut.   Many well-understood nonclassical logics countenance inconsistencies 
as well.
