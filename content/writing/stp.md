In this article, I praise Hartry Field's fine book <em>Saving Truth From Paradox</em> (Oxford University Press, 2008).  I also show that his account of properties is threatened by a paradox,  and I explain how we can only avoid this paradox by coming to a clearer understanding the connections between accepting and rejecting (or assertion and denial) and the identity conditions for properties.
