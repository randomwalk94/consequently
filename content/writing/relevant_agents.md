Majer and Peli&scaron; have proposed a relevant logic for epistemic agents, providing a novel extension of the relevant logic R with a distinctive epistemic modality K, which is at the one and the same time factive (K&phi; &rarr; &phi; is a theorem) and an existential normal modal operator (K(&phi; &or; &psi;) &rarr; (K&phi; &or; K&psi;) is also a theorem). The intended interpretation is that K&phi; holds (relative to a situation s) if there is a resource available at s, confirming &phi;. In this article we expand the class of models to the broader class of &lsquo;general epistemic frames&rsquo;. With this generalisation we provide a sound and complete axiomatisation for the logic of general relevant epistemic frames. We also show, that each of the modal axioms characterises some natural subclasses of general frames.
