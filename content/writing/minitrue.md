Minimalists about truth say that the important properties of the 
truth predicate are revealed in the class of <em>T</em>-biconditionals. Most 
minimalists demur from taking <em>all</em> of the <em>T</em>-biconditionals 
of the form "&lt;<em>p</em>&gt; is true if and only if <em>p</em>&rdquo;, to be true, because to do so leads to paradox.  But exactly <em>which</em> biconditionals turn out to be true?  I take a leaf out of the epistemic account of vagueness 
to show how the minimalist can avoid giving a comprehensive answer to that 
question.  I also show that this response is entailed by 
taking minimalism seriously, and that objections to this position may be usefully aided and abetted by Gupta and Belnap's revision theory of truth.
