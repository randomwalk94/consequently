Shapiro and Taschek have argued that simply using intuitionistic logic and its Heyting semantics, one can show that there are no gaps in warranted assertibility. That is, given that a discourse is faithfully modelled using Heyting&rdquo;s semantics for the logical constants, that if a statement <em>S</em> is not warrantedly assertible, then its negation <em>~S</em> is. Tennant has argued for this conclusion on similar grounds. I show that these arguments fail, albeit in illuminating ways. I will show that an appeal to constructive logic does not commit one to this strong epistemological thesis, but that appeals to semantics of intuitionistic logic nonetheless <em>do</em> give us certain conclusions about the connections between warranted assertibility and truth.
