<p>
I update &ldquo;<a href="http://consequently.org/writing/ten/">Truthmakers, Entailment and Necessity</a>&rdquo; with a response to Stephen Read's wonderful <em>Mind</em> 2000 argument to the effect that I got the disjunction thesis wrong.
</p>
<p>
I think I didn't get it wrong, but figuring out <em>why</em> it's OK to hold that a truthmaker makes a disjunction true iff it makes a disjunct true is not as straightforward as I first thought.  Pluralism about truthmaking makes an entrance.
