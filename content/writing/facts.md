Stephen Neale, in <em>Facing Facts</em> takes theories of facts, truthmakers, and non-extensional connectives to be threatened by triviality in the face of powerful "slingshot" arguments. In this paper I rehearse the most powerful of these arguments, and then show that friends of facts have resources sufficient to not only resist slingshot arguments but also to be untroubled by them. If a fact theory is provided with a model, then the fact theorist can be sure that this theory is secure from triviality arguments.
