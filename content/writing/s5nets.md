In this paper I introduce a sequent system for the propositional modal logic S5.  Derivations of valid sequents in the system are shown to correspond to proofs in a novel natural deduction system of <em>circuit proofs</em> (reminiscient of proofnets in linear logic, or multiple-conclusion calculi for classical logic).

The sequent derivations and proofnets are both simple extensions of sequents and proofnets for classical propositional logic, in which the new machinery&mdash;to take account of the modal vocabulary&mdash;is directly motivated in terms of the simple, universal Kripke semantics for S5. 
The sequent system is cut-free and the circuit proofs are normalising.
