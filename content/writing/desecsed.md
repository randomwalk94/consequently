In classical and intuitionistic arithmetics, any formula implies a true equation, and a false equation implies anything. In weaker logics fewer implications hold. In this paper we rehearse known results about the relevant arithmetic R#, and we show that in linear arithmetic LL# by contrast false equations never imply true ones. As a result, linear arithmetic is <em>desecsed</em>. A formula <em>A</em> which entails 0=0 is a <em>secondary equation</em>; one entailed by 0&ne;0 is a <em>secondary unequation</em>. A system of formal arithmetic is <em>secsed</em> if every extensional formula is either a secondary equation or a secondary unequation. We are indebted to the program <tt>MaGIC</tt> for the simple countermodel <b>SZ7</b>, on which 0=1 is not a secondary formula. This is a small but significant success for automated reasoning.
