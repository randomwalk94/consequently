Molinism is an attempt to do equal justice to divine foreknowledge and human freedom.  For Molinists, human freedom <em>fits</em> in this universe for the future is open or unsettled.  However, God's middle knowledge -- God's contingent knowledge of what agents would freely do in this or that circumstance -- underwrites God's omniscience in the midst of this openness.    

In this paper I rehearse Nuel Belnap and Mitchell Green's argument in 'Indeterminism and the Thin Red Line' against the reality of a distinguished single future in the context of branching time, and show that it applies applies equally against Molinism + branching time.  In the process, we show how contemporary work in the logic of temporal notions in the context of branching time (specifically, Prior--Thomason semantics) can illuminate discussions in the metaphysics of freedom and divine knowledge.
