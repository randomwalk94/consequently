According to Stephen Read, Thomas Bradwardine&rsquo;s theory of truth provides an independently motivated solution to the paradoxes of truth, such as the liar. In a series of papers, I have discussed modal models for Read&rsquo;s reconstruction of Bradwardine&rsquo;s theory. In this paper, provide a hypersequent calculus for this theory, and I show that the cut rule is admissible in the hypersequent calculus.

(This paper is dedicated to Professor Stephen Read, whose work has been a profound influence on my own. His work on relevant logic, on proof theoretical harmony, on the logic of identity and on Thomas Brad- wardine&rsquo;s theory of truth have been a rich source of insight, of stimulation and of provocation. In an attempt to both honour Stephen, and hopefully to give him some pleasure, I am going to attempt to cook up something original using some of the many and varied ingredients he has provided us. In this paper, I will mix and match ideas and techniques from Stephen&rsquo;s papers on proof theory, on Bradwardine&rsquo;s theory of truth, and on identity to offer a harmonious sequent system for a theory of truth inspired by Stephen Read&rsquo;s recovery of the work of Thomas Bradwardine.)
