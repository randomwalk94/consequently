We consider the virtues of relevant arithmetic couched in the logic <b>E</b> of <em>entailment</em> as opposed to <b>R</b> of relevant implication.  The move to a stronger logic allows us to construct a complete system of <em>true</em> arithmetic, in which whenever an entailment <em>A &rarr; B</em> is not true (an example: 0=2 &rarr; 0=1 is not provable) then its negation ~(<em>A &rarr; B</em>) is true.
