I'd like to guage some philosophical opinions.  (I don't have many of my own.  Most of them have been worn down by <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/">years of logical abuse</a>.)  

First, some pre-requisites:

1. Let's understand 'possibly' as a *metaphysical* sort of possibility.  If it helps, think of it as truth in some possible world, no matter how outlandish.  

2. Let's understand *a priori knowledge* in the way that all of the people who talk about *a priori* knowledge understand the term.  Plausibly, we can't know that Hesperus is Phosphorus *a priori*, but, plausibly, we can know the Chinese Remainder Theorem *a priori*.

Here's the question. Can we have *a priori* knowledge of any proposition of the form

> possibly ~*p* 

where *p* is true?  (We don't need to know *a priori* that *p* is true.)  Speaking rather briskly, do we have *a priori* knowledge that fatalism is false? (Where 'fatalism' is the thesis that everything that is true is metaphysically necessary.)  This is fudging a scope distinction, commuting a propositional quantifier under the knowledge operator, but that doesn't seem like *too* much of a worry.  If you think that there's a proposition '@' true in the actual world alone (of any of the possible worlds accessible from the actual world) then, the question reduces to this:

> Can we know *a priori* that possibly ~@?

What do *you* think?  What do the *Standard Positions* on these topics (*a priori* knowledge, necessity, semantics, etc.) say about this?   Is there anything that we obviously have *a priori* knowledge of that clearly *a priori* entails possibly ~@?  (That'd be interesting: I can't think of any examples right now...)  

Anyway, if you're the kind of person to have opinions on these sorts of issues, let me know what you think in the comments.
