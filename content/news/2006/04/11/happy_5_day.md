Happy fifth birthday, Z!

Today it's unwrapping presents, a quiet family breakfast and lego-making, talking to grand-dad on the telephone, a little practice on the new bike, some school, and dinner together with more fiddling around with the new presents.

The *Party* is on Saturday.  (Wish us luck. We've not hosted a fifth birthday party before.)
