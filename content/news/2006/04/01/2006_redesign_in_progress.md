I'm trying to neaten up this place a bit, and I need your help and advice.  Have a look <a href="http://consequently.org/newindex.php">here</a> and let me know what you think of it.  I'm trying to make it easier to see what's new, what's changed, etc.  In particular, you look *down* to find links to other new stuff on the site.  This opens up the sidebars for four things.  The most recent picture, my "recently browsed" linklist, my list of events (which I need to update) and finally, a very modest list of links to friends and colleagues.

So, what do you think?  Clearer?  Simpler?  Easier to understand?  Or not?  Does it break in your browser?  Leave a comment and let me know.
