This afternoon I was interviewed by Lisa Mitchell from <a href="http://www.theage.com.au">The Age</a> about academic blogging.  She's writing an article for the [education supplement](http://www.education.theage.com.au/inpaper.asp) (published on Mondays).  It's a piece with a long lead time.  

I wonder if I'll recognise anything I said in the article, and if she'll quote me.  (I blabbed on for 25 minutes.  I hope there was some useful raw material there *somewhere*.)
