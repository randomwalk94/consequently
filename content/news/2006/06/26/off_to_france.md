Today I'm flying off to Nancy for [(Anti)R&eacute;alismes Logique &amp; M&eacute;taphysique](http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/poincare/colloques/AR06/eindex.htm).  It should be an interesting meeting: the program is [here](http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/poincare/colloques/AR06/eprogram.htm).  If I get time to edit my paper on the plane, I'll try posting the text of the paper before I give it, internet access permitting.
