I just had an *Idea* today. From here, it seems like a *Really* *Neat* *Idea*.  (Having the idea made me remember what it feels like to prove something you've been struggling with for a long time: a mix of excitement, wonder, awe, relief, and much else besides. It's welcome to be reminded of why I like working in logic.) 

This idea isn't a new theorem, but what seems to me to be a simpler proof of an already proved theorem.  I'll try writing it up in the next couple of days and I'll report back.  It could dissolve into dust and vapour, but if it survives the writeup process, I'll be one happy logician.  If it doesn't survive, at least I'll have learned something new.
