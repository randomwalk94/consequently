I _think_ [that](http://smh.com.au/news/commonwealth-games/melbourne-we-did-it/2006/03/26/1143330923113.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2) was a knowing, self-reflective and ironic appropriation of Australian (and Melburnian) parochialism, but I'm not altogether sure about how the irony was received, given the [insipid television commentary](http://tvguide.ninemsn.com.au/cu/default.asp?pid=14286318).

Still, anything a [72 year old bloke in drag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Humphries) [with purple hair](http://www.dame-edna.com/) who shot to fame (such fame as it was) knowingly making fun of Melbourne suburban life and other Australian attitudes can't be all that bad.
