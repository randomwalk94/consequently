It's a happy day for us logicians at Melbourne.  [Greg Hjorth](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~greg/) is going to be joining the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/) later in the year, taking up a five-year, professorial fellowship.  He's a super-smart set theorist and model theorist, and I'm looking forward to having him around on campus.
