Z and I went in to the city to have a look at the [Women's](http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule%20and%20Results/By%20Sport/Athletics/Sun%2019%20Mar/Results/Result%20-%20AT1099E0100001?ScheduleItemID=28953) and [Men's](http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule%20and%20Results/By%20Sport/Athletics/Sun%2019%20Mar/Results/Result%20-%20AT0099E0100001?ScheduleItemID=28935) Marathon held here for the [2006 Commonwealth Games](http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/).  The city was buzzing, the crowds friendly, and it was great to get a glimpse of the lead runners: especially [Kerryn McCann and Hellen Cherono Koskei](http://consequently.org/phonecam/Kerryn%20McCann%20and%20Hellen%20Cheron%20Koskei,%20Commonwealth%20Games%20Marathon,%20Alexandra%20Gardens,%20March%2019,%202006.jpg) who raced neck-and-neck right into the stadium.  No matter how you cut it, 42+ kilometres is a long way to run.  I suppose the task is quite literally, a *marathon* effort.

C arrived with lunch when the marathon had finished, and our afternoon was wrapped up with some great live music from [Ravi Bandhu Vidyapathy](http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Festival+Melbourne2006/Performances/profiles/Ravi+Bandhu+Vidyapathy.htm) and friends from Sri Lanka, at the Festival site down at [Alexandra Gardens](http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Festival+Melbourne2006/Locations/Alexandra+Gardens.htm).  Even for people who have a middling interest in sport, like me, the Commonweath Games has brought its own kind of spark into the city.

Watch out for Friday night, when Z and I head down to the [athletics at the MCG](http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule+and+Results/By+Sport/Athletics?SelectedDate=Fri%2024%20Mar).
