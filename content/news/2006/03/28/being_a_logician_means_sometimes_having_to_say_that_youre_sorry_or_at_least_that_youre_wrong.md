I'm sorry, I truly am.

Back in the period 1990-1992, I wrote a couple of papers on the semantics of relevant logics.  I thought they were pretty nifty, and I submitted them to a [prestigious journal](http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0022-3611).  They got accepted.  The first of these papers is "[Simplified Semantics for Relevant Logics (and some of their rivals)](http://consequently.org/writing/simpsem/)."  

Unfortunatley, there's a hole in the middle of this paper.  That's the problem with being a logician, people can sometimes _prove_ you wrong by presenting a counterexample to your claim.  That's the nice thing about playing a game with relatively clear rules.  You can figure out what constitutes good play!

Anyway, [Tony Roy](http://cal.csusb.edu/Faculty/Philosophy/roy/) did a fantastic job of isolating the problem, which exists in not only my paper, but Graham Priest's text *[An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic](http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/052179434X/consequentlyorg)*, which followed the simplified semantics rather closely.   The problem is serious, for in _my_ semantics for the relevant logic  R, it turns out that disjunctive syllogism (the inference from *A* v *B* and ~*A* to *B*) is valid, and it shouldn't be.  

Tony isolated the problem, and we came up with a fix.  The result is the paper "[On Permutation in Simplified Semantics](http://consequently.org/writing/permutation)."  Please take a look over it before we sent it off to a journal.

Oh, and to the greater philosophical community (or at least, the tiny fraction that has come across this paper) -- I'm sorry for deceiving you.  I hope this paper helps make up for it.
