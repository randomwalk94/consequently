I forgot to mention that I have written another paper recently.  It's a proof theory paper, putting down some thoughts on modal proof theory that I formulated when giving the [S5 paper](http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets) around and about in the last six months or so.  

In "[Comparing Modal Sequent Systems](http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal/)" I look at different ways to understand modal deduction.  In particular, I argue that you can understand *labelled* proof systems -- those in which proofs consist of statements annotated with labels, often thought of as denoting 'possible worlds' at least in modal proof theory -- can be reconceived in such a way as to not _really_ require talk of worlds.  When you play close attention to the kind of work done by the labels, it can be understood instead as a different representation of a *structural* feature of modal deduction.

The point in this paper is a technical one, but the moral is broader than that.  The view I argue for in the '[Invention](http://consequently.org/writing/invention)' paper feeds off this kind of point.  Properly *modal* deduction involves doing new things in the structure of argument -- you can do a kind of *supposing* (say, 'hypothetical' supposing), which has its own interesting behaviour.

Or so I think, anyway.  In [this](http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal) paper I look the issue by way of a comparison between labelled deduction and display logic.  Display Logic is maligned for being complicated, but not for failing to be 'structural.'  No-one accuses Display Logic of importing explicit talk possible worlds into proofs.  Labelled deduction is criticised for doing exactly that, but it has nice properties.  In the paper, I show how you can get from display logic to Labelled Deduction, and thereby get a new view on labelled modal systems, inheriting some of the *structural* features of display logic, but which has its own kind of simplicity and charm.

If you're a logician, I'd love to know what you think of it.  Download it from [here](http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal) and [leave a comment](http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal).  I've submitted it for presentation at [AiML 2006](http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~aiml06/).

Hey.  Look at that.  Two posts in one day.  Even with some philosophico-logical content.  I think I can make it three...
