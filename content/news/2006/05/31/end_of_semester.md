We've finished lectures for the semester, and I'm officially <em>recovering</em>.  It was fun teaching [Logic](http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub) and [Non-Classical Logic](http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161212/pub), but it was also a hard slog.  Next semester I have a light teaching load, with my honours logic seminar.

The highlight last week was [Richard Zach's visit](http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/2006/05/on-road-again.html).  He gave two nice talks.  One on vagueness and logic -- setting out different options for logic and semantics in the light of vagueness -- and the other, on the epsilon calculus.  (How Richard managed to get through the content of [his big paper with Georg Moser](http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/papers/etheorem.pdf) in an hour with each of us following everything, I have _no_ idea, but he did.)

Now I have to slog through some marking, and some writing.  This weekend, however, I'm in Adelaide for a little ``logic axis'' meeting.  I'll give a talk on fixing up Prawitz's proof theory for the positive fragment of the relevant logic R.  I'm still working on the written version of the paper.
