I've listened to [the interview](http://consequently.org/news/2006/07/18/interviewed_again/), and I'm pretty happy with how it went.  The ABC team did a good job with the editing (I think the interview I recorded was a bit over 30 minutes).  I never thought that I'd live to hear the day that someone explained the semantics of first degree entailment on national radio, and I was especially grateful that my little plug for [Richard Sylvan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sylvan) and [Bob Meyer](http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/) didn't end up on the cutting-room floor. 

For your edification, the [transcript is of the interview here](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2006/1689459.htm) and the audio is an [MP3 file available for the next four weeks](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/feeds/pze_20060722.mp3).  You can [subscribe to a podcast](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/subscribe/) of the program if you like to hear this kind of thing more regularly.

If you're visiting my website on following the link from the Philosopher's Zone page and you want to know more about logic, there are a few things you could do.

* Download my little introductory article "[Logic](http://consequently.org/writing/logic_chapter/)" in a nice volume called the *Fundamentals of Philosophy* edited by John Shand.   

* My textbook, also imaginatively entitled *[Logic](http://consequently.org/logic/)* is an introduction to the subject, geared to philosophy students.  You can order it from [Amazon US](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415400686/consequentlyorg) or [Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415400686/consequentlyorg).

* If you're interested in *pluralism* about logic, the topic I ended my discussion with Alan on, then you'll want to have a look at my book *[Logical Pluralism](http://consequently.org/writing/logical_pluralism/)* co-authored with my friend [JC Beall](http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/beall/beall.html) from the University of Connecticut.  You can get this book from [Amazon US](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199288410/consequentlyorg) or [Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199288410/consequentlyorg).
