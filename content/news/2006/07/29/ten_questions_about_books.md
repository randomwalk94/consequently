Since [Jo asked so nicely](http://jcrankers.blogspot.com/2006/07/book-meme.html), I'll add my answers to the [one book meme](http://faith-theology.blogspot.com/2006/07/one-book-meme.html) that's going around the place.

1. *One book that changed your life*

   Robert C. Roberts, *[Spirituality and Human Emotion](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802819397/consequentlyorg)*.

   > It's because of this book that I'm a philosopher, believe it or not.  Reading it, I saw that the philosophy needn't be self-contained, but could be used to say something productive and interesting about matters of human concern.  In my undergraduate years I spent a *lot* of time reading theology, and I learned most from the literature that was philosohpical in technique and in style.

2. *One book you've read more than once*

   C. S. Lewis, *[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0064471071/consequentlyorg)*.

   > My out-and-out favourite of the Narnia Chronicles.

3. *One book you'd want on a desert island*

   *The Gospel according to John*

    > Following Jo's example, I'll treat different biblical books as different books.  For me it's a toss-up for different gospels, but John's the one I'm least 'at home' with and I think it bears repeated readings, as is fitting on a desert island.

4. *One book that made you laugh*

   Stanislaw Lem, *[The Cyberiad](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156027593/consequentlyorg)*.

   > It's an intellectual laugh mostly, rather than slapstick, but there are laughs on each page of these wise, knowing, sensitive tales of the robot constructors Trurl and Klaupacius.

5. *One book that made you cry*

    David Mitchell, *[Cloud Atlas](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375507256/consequentlyorg)*.

   > A truly vertiginous read: six interlocking stories from the 1850s, through the present, to the near future and after the collapse of civilisation.  Deeply moving.

6. *<del>One</del><ins>Two</ins> book<ins>s</ins> you wish had been written*

    Richard Routley, *Exploring Meinong's Jungle & Beyond, <ins>the edited version</ins>*. 

    > The [existing version](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0685056368/consequentlyorg) version is an amazing read, but with a good *edit* it could have changed the face of philosophy in this country.  In a very good way.

    Alan Anderson, Nuel Belnap, J. Michael Dunn <ins>and Robert K. Meyer</ins>, *Entailment, Volume 2*.  

    > The [existing *Entailment, Vol 2*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691073392/consequentlyorg) is very good, but the version that was foreshadowed in the first volume of *Entailment* would have been fantastic.  But that would have required the continuing of the Belnap/Meyer collaboration, which broke down in the 1980s. 

7. *One book you wish had never been written*

   > I find it hard to answer this question, so I'll interpret it differently.

   David Marr and Marian Wilkinson, *[Dark Victory](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1741144477/consequentlyorg)*.

  > It is unutterably sad that this book *had* to be written.  I wish that it had been impossible to write because the events had never taken place.  Instead, we've got to make sure that they never happen again.

8. *One book you're currently reading*

    PD James, *[The Children of Men](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446364622/consequentlyorg)*.

    > I've got a thing for well-written dystopias.

9. *One book you've been meaning to read*

   Colin Tudge,  *[So Shall we Reap](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141009500/consequentlyorg)*.

    > I started reading this before the sabbatical last year, and I didn't take it with me -- it's still lying in my pile of things to read.  It's got a wonderful subtitle: "How Everyone Who Is Liable to Be Born in the Next Ten Thousand Years Could Eat Very Well Indeed; and Why, in Practice, Our Immediate Descendants Are Likely to Be in Serious Trouble".

10. *Tag five people*
