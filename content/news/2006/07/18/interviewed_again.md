This morning I trooped down to the ABC Melbourne studios in Southbank, to sit in a ['Tardis' booth](http://imaginingaustralia.blogs.com/photos/launch/andrewpetetardisbooth.html) to talk to [Alan Saunders of *The Philosopher's Zone*](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/about/default.htm#presenter) on logic, the liar paradox and other stuff I think about.  Alan was feeling unwell and suffering from a croaky voice, so the interview that goes to air might be more of a monologue than what took place in the recording.  

Regardless, it was good fun to do the interview: Alan's a good interviewer and he knows his stuff. Tune in or [download the interview](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2006/1689459.htm) once it airs on July 22.  (The ABC keeps these program files online for a month.)  

If you, like me, are interested in this kind of radio program, you can always [subscribe to the podcast](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/subscribe/default.htm#podcasting) to get the latest program when it is released.

Last month I was [interviewed for *The Age*](http://consequently.org/news/2006/06/06/interviewed/), this month, it's radio.  What is coming next?
