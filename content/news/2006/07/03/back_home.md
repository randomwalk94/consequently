I'm back in Melbourne, after my whirlwind jaunt in Nancy.  I was in too much of a rush on Day 4 of the conference to post thoughts on Day 3 or Day 4.  I promise I'll do that once I recover from my jetlag and deal with my growing pile of mail, both snail and electronic. 

In other news, the nicest thing about reading [this article on blogging in this morning's newspaper](http://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/adventures-in-blog-land/2006/07/01/1151174437503.html?page=fullpage) was hearing Z's laugh when he recognised that a picture of me was in the newspaper. "That's you, Dad!" he chortled when he recognised me.
