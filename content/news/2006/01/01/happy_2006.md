Happy New Year, my readers!  

We've landed in Melbourne (to a hot 8pm at around 42 degrees Celcius), and are slowly reconstructing our household bit by bit.  The internet connection seems to work at least.  We've managed to change lightbulbs, unpack bags, look at a bit of our large pile of mail, get the boy to bed (and even to sleep) and have some [Kaya Toast](http://www.yakun.com/) for a midnight or New Year snack.

See you later in 2006.
