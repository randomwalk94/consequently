You're all invited to a party on Tuesday, October 17 (5:30pm for 6pm) at the [Melbourne University Bookshop](http://www.bookshop.unimelb.edu.au/) to celebrate the publication of five books in Logic and Philosophy here in the [Philosophy Department at Melbourne](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au).   Here are the books:

* _[Models, Truth and Realism](http://www.amazon.com/Models-Truth-Realism-Barry-Taylor/dp/0199286698/consquentlyorg),_ Barry Taylor.
* _[Doubt Truth to be a Liar](http://www.amazon.com/Doubt-Truth-Liar-Graham-Priest/dp/0199263280/consequentlyorg),_ Graham Priest.
* _[In Contradiction](http://www.amazon.com/Contradiction-Study-Transconsistent-Graham-Priest/dp/0199263302/consequentlyorg),_ Graham Priest.
* _[Logic](http://www.amazon.com/Logic-Introduction-Fundamentals-Greg-Restall/dp/0773524231/consequentlyorg),_ Greg Restall
* _[Logical Pluralism](http://www.amazon.com/Logical-Pluralism-J-C-Beall/dp/0199288410/consequentlyorg),_ JC Beall and Greg Restall.

Details of the party are found on [this flyer](http://consequently.org/misc/logiclaunch.pdf).  If you're planning to come, you need to email the bookshop (the address is on the flyer) to RSVP for catering purposes.

I'm really pleased to be a part of such a productive research community, and it's nice to throw a little party to recognise that.  Do come if you can make it: I hope to see you there!
