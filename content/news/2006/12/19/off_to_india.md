I've been having too much fun and doing too much work lately to post anything here.  On the work side, our proposal to teach first-year logic in an interdisciplinary way as a "breadth" subject to all students in the "new generation" degrees from 2008, has passed the first hurdle.  We have a bucket of money to develop the course over the next year.  Lots of work, but lots of fun.

  On the fun side, we've been getting ready to go to India for our family holiday.  Landing in Mumbai, we go straight to Pune for Christmas with friends, and then we wend our way down the south-east coast on our way to Trivandrum. We're off tomorrow, and we'll be back in Melbourne on January 15.

See you in 2007.
