In the [Philosophy Department](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au) we're pleased to be hosting some short visits from [Gillian Russell](http://logicandlanguage.net/), and [Jon Cohen](http://thatlogicblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/ahoy-melbourne.html).  It's neat to be in a place where smart people come to visit, think and talk to you.  

Last week we had a couple of logic seminars from neat west-coast of the USA types: [Mike Titelbaum](https://webfiles.berkeley.edu:443/titelbaum/home.htm) from Berkeley and [Stanley Peters](http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~peters/) from Stanford.  At drinks after the logic seminar I met [Mark Steedman](http://www.iccs.inf.ed.ac.uk/~steedman/) from Edinburgh, and it was nice to have a symmetric reaction "oh, you're *X*, I'm *Y*" for *X* and *Y* in {'MS','GR'}.  He was able to fill me in on the very interesting work done on substructrual logics, categorial grammar, and statistical parsing.
