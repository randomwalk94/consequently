(These are entries from my blog from 2000 and early 2001. They were originally hosted on a small server at <a href="http://mq.edu.au">Macquarie University</a>. Most of the links are dead now, but I have kept them as they are here, for nostalgia&rsquo;s sake.)

 <h3>Thursday, March 1</h3>
 
     <blockquote>
     The action is no longer at <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log">http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/log</a>.  It is now all happening at <a 
     href="http://consequently.org/">consequently.org</a>.  The archives of 
     this site remain here (see the list of dates above), but eventually 
     these will be moved over to the <a href="http://consequently.org">new site</a> too.
     <p>
     See you <a href="http://consequently.org/">there</a>.
