Just today, I stumbled across [a video of an interview with me from 2013](https://vimeo.com/102098742), explaining our thinking behind [teaching introductory logic](http://consequently.org/class/2015/logic1_coursera/) [on Coursera](http://consequently.org/class/2015/logic2_coursera/), and the connections between this and [classroom teaching](http://consequently.org/class/2015/UNIB10002). Come for the ideas, stay for the crazy hand gestures.
