I'm delighted to *finally* announce that I have a [job to offer](http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/885576/postdoctoral-fellow-philosophy) on my five year ARC funded research project in philosophical logic and its applications, &ldquo;Meaning in Action: new techniques for language, logic and information.&rdquo; It's a two year postdoctoral research position, with a little bit of teaching on the side. If you're interested in philosophical logic, and would like to join the logic group at Melbourne, this is the job for *you*.

Details are [online at the University of Melbourne careers site](http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/885576/postdoctoral-fellow-philosophy), and if you  applying, you should read the [project description](/misc/DP150103801_app.pdf) so you can address how you would contribute to the research project in your application for the job. To apply, follow the instructions [on the University of Melbourne careers site](http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/885576/postdoctoral-fellow-philosophy). The closing date for the application is **April 19, 2015** (That's *Melbourne* time. Don't be bitten by thinking that midnight April 19 *your* time is still April 19 *our* time.) If you have any questions, don't hesitate to get back to me. And let everyone know about this position. I'll be delighted to have a strong field of applicants. This is an exciting research project, and I'm looking forward to working on it with others.  

**Update:** Here are a few answers to questions I&rsquo;ve been asked:

* There is no fixed starting date for the position, though if you can be on board for [Semester 2, 2015](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/unisec/PDates/acadcale.html), that's a strong plus.

* The teaching responsibilities for the position are small (at most 1/4 of the workload), and are to be decided in consultation with me&mdash;this part of the role is to give the candidate some teaching experience, and to cover a little of my teaching to free me up to do some more research. Take a look at [my teaching](/class/) over the last few years, and you'll get an idea of the opportunities for teaching.

If you have other questions about the position, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](#about), and if you know some likely candidates, please point them this way.
