<p>I've just been invited to give a lecture at the <a href="http://www.uniovi.es/Congresos/2003/DLMPS/">12th International Congress of Logic Methodology and Philosophy of Science</a> in <a href="">Oveido</a>, in August, 2003.  This is Very Nice.  The first really <em>big</em> international conference I ever attended  to was the <a href="http://www.uniovi.es/Congresos/2003/DLMPS/Earlier/Welcome.htm">10th LMPS Congress in Florence</a> in 1995 (I was a postdoc then), and I had a truly wonderful time.  I gave an early version of my "<a href="http://consequently.org/publications.html#negrl">Negation in Relevant Logic</a>" as a "contributed paper".  It's a great honour to be one of the invited lecturers (not least because invited lectures get a slot of around an hour, and contributed ones go for around 15 minutes!) and I'm delighted to get the opportunity.</p>
