<p>I don't normally spend my time worrying about the monopolistic practices of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">that software company</a>, but <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25085.html">this case</a> is too bizarre to go unremarked.  In a nutshell, at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/education/?id=DonatedComputers">this site</a> Microsoft explain that if a computer is donated to a school, it's a <em>legal requirement</em> that the original software installed on the computer be donated with it.  Notice that they agree that the school can <em>upgrade</em> the software on the computer to another version of Windows.  Why, then, should the school not accept computers which have been previously upgraded with <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">another</a> <a href="http://www.linux.org">operating</a> <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/darwin/">system</a>?  When is an upgrade allowed, and when is it not?</p>
