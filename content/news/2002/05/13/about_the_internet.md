<p>... the Internet radically redefines a person's psychological relationship to time and space. Attention is rivetted on what is tangible, useful, instantly available; the stimulus for deeper thought and reflection may be lacking. Yet human beings have a vital need for time and inner quiet to ponder and examine life and its mysteries, and to grow gradually into a mature dominion of themselves and of the world around them.

<p>That was from the <em>Pope</em>, in a message urging the Church to get into the internet (but to also beware of its limitations).  David Weinberger has an <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_05_01_archive.html#85081552">interesting response</a>, highlighting the difference between seeing <em>proclaiming a message</em> and <em>engaging in conversation</em>.  The Holy Father seems keen on the former, without showing much enthusiasm for the latter.</p>
