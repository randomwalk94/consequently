<p>Consequently.org now has a new home.  It's no longer hosted from my desk at work.  It's now hosted by <a href="http://www.segpub.com.au/">professionals</a>.  This way, it will continue to exist even when I'm "between desks" in late June.  Hopefully the transition has been unnoticed by you.  (It was relatively painless here.)</p>
