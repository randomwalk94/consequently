<p>There are <a href="http://www.dest.gov.au/crossroads/pubs.htm">more</a> rumblings about higher education and its funding here in Australia.  Everyone agrees that universities are underfunded, but there is not a whole lot of agreement about what to do about it.  The <a href="http://www.dest.gov.au/crossroads/pubs.htm">recent discussion paper</a>, flagging increased deregulation for public universities, has sparked <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/lm/stories/s541198.htm">some debate</a>.  I notice a change in my own reaction to these things, as I move from a <a href="http://www.mq.edu.au/">middle-ranking university</a> to <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">one set to benefit from any deregulation</a>.</p>
