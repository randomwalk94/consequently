<p>Zack is learning <em>object permanence</em>.  Just now he&rsquo;s spent a couple of delightful minutes putting 
<a href="http://www.aardman.com/wallaceandgromit/homesweethome/shaun/index.shtml">Shaun</a> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/5104/">the</a> <a href="http://members.aol.com/IoneDeGraf/">Sheep</a> on a cupboard shelf, closing the door.  Waiting a while, opening the door, smiling, picking up Shaun, closing the door, then opening it again and repeating the process.  Ad infinitum.  I think he's getting the point that Shaun is still there, even if the door is closed.</p><p>Now that this is done, he's taking my black pen, putting it up on the desk out of his sight, but in his reach, waiting a while, then picking it up again and repeating the process.</p>
