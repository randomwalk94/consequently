<p>"The text is wonderfully clear and avoids the tedium of many introductory logic texts. The examples, exercises, and suggestions for further reading are all good. This is the only introductory text I know of that introduces students to some of the philosophical problems logic pertains to and intersects with. It is the type of book I would like to use for an introductory course and recommend it enthusiastically."  &mdash;  <a href="http://mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=860">Michael Hallett, Philosophy Department, McGill University</a>.</p><p>Thanks!</p>
