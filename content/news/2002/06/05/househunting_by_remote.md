<p>I'm spending most of my time and emotional energy finding a place to live in Melbourne.  It's now <em>possible</em> to do a fair bit of this at a distance, due to <a href="http://www.realestate.com.au/">websites</a> listing <a href="http://www.realestateview.com.au/">available properties</a>, but of course you have to be there to inspect properties.  Timing, as usual, is <em>almost everything</em>.  In this business <em>money</em> is also almost everything.  It follows that timing overlaps a great deal with money&mdash;which has been noticed before.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm flying down to Melbourne this weekend to take a personal look at a few rental properties, and hopefully to place a bond on a suitable one.  Given that we move in 3 weeks' time, I'll be spending less time online until we're up and settled in our new home.</p>
