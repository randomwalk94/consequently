<p>It's come to my attention that my old Macquarie Uni email address is bouncing.  If you want to email me about personal things, use my consequently.org email address: <a href="mailto:greg@consequently.org">greg@consequently.org</a>.  If you want to email me about work things, use my University of Melbourne email address "restall at unimelb.edu.au".  (Convert that text into the obvious email adddress.  This is an attempt to reduce the amount of spam I get delivered to my work address, at the very least!)</p>
