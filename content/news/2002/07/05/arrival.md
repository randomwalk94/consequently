<p>Moving house is tiring.  Moving house with a young child is exciting, but very tiring.  Moving house to a new city, and rewiring your brain to cope with the changes in weather, shopping, driving, childcare, work, and the innumerable other habits which need to be unlearned and relearned, is very very tiring.  Moving house and waiting five days for your personal effects to catch up with you is not so much <em>tiring</em> as extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>But we're here in Melbourne, we're happy, and we're settling in.</p>
