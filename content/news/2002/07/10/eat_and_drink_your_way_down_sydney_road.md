<p>This looks like the course for me: <a href="http://www.cae.edu.au/pdfs/DH/VISIT%20SYDNEY%20ROAD.pdf">Visit Sydney Road</a> (warning, it's a PDF file).  The <a href="http://www.cae.edu.au/">Centre for Adult Education</a> offers a one-day course on the main road just near my place.  Looks like a nice way to spend 11 to 2 on Saturday.
