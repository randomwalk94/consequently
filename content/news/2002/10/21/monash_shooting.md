<p>The terrible <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2002/10/item20021021120337_1.htm">shooting at Monash University</a> took place in the building housing the Philosophy Department, and at which I gave a seminar in one month ago.
No-one I know was physically hurt, but I'm sure everyone who works in that building will find it hard to go back to work tomorrow.</p>
