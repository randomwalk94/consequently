<p>This is seriously elegant: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/08/science/08MATH.html">Apparently</a>, three Indian mathematicians have shown that you can test primality (deterministically) in polynomial time.  That's incredible.  More incredible, I seem to <em>understand</em> the <a href="http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/news/primality.html">paper</a>.  (The authors seem proud as punch, as you'd expect, cracking a centuries old problem.)</p>
