<p>I love the way the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2560683.stm">BBC news report</a> about the <em>High Court of Australia</em>'s interesting decision on defamation and internet sites leads with a really nice picture of the <a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/">National Library of Australia</a>.  The library is <em>next door</em> to the High Court, which is a <a href="http://www.highcourt.gov.au/">very different building</a>.</p>
