<p>The <em>Wired</em> <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/solaris_pr.html">article on the upcoming movie adaptation of Stanislaw Lem&rsquo;s novel, <em>Solaris</em></a> is surprisingly good.  It doesn&rsquo;t encourage me to go and see the movie, but it does make me want to go back and reread my Lem novels and short stories.</p>
