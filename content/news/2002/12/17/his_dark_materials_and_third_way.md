<p>I just found a very insightful <a href="http://www.thirdway.org.uk/past/showpage.asp?page=3949">interview with Philip Pullman</a>, the author of the <em>His Dark Materials</em> trilogy.  I haven't read the trilogy yet, but I probably will before I get to Harry Potter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thirdway.org.uk">Third Way</a>, the mob who published the interview, produce some of the best (Christian) theologically informed social comment around.  Sadly, that's not saying very much, given the quality of most Christian writing, but Third Way is still very good.  Their <a href="http://www.thirdway.org.uk">site</a> is worth a browse.</p> 
<p>P.S. <em>Third Way</em> predates New Labour, the rise of Tony Blair and the articulation of "Third Way" Politics <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Giddens/FAQs.htm#Third%20way%20politics">by Anthony Giddens</a> by many years.  The magazine was <a href="http://www.thirdway.org.uk/in/history.asp">launched in 1977</a>, significantly predating the reformation of the British Labour Party.</p>
