<p>With the arrival of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/ichat.html">iChat</a>, I now have an instant messaging client.  My AIM (<a href="aim.aol.com">AOL Instant Messenger</a>) username is <em>cutelimination</em>.  If you have a chat client and you want to contact me that way, you could always check if I'm online.  I'm not online <em>that</em> often, but you can try your luck.</p>
