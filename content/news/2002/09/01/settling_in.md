<p>Sorry for the lack of updates lately.  We've been slowly settling in to Melbourne.  Zack loves his <a href="http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/childcare/centres/qbcontact.html">childcare</a>, but settling in has meant a range of new infections in quick succession.  (Conjunctivitis, a severe ear infection and gastroenteritis.)  The latter, he managed to give to me, and this has meant that I now have new insight into the etymology of the term &ldquo;wretched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Still, here are a few highlights of recent weeks. First, <a href="http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub/">my logic students</a> (they're bright and enthusiastic), the logic seminars we've run each Friday for the last few weeks (it's <em>great</em> to be in a place where we have the critical mass to sustain a regular seminar), the <a href="http://www.bellshakespeare.com.au/">Bell Shakespeare</a> production of <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> (in the pre-play warmup when the magician <em>Pinch</em> was doing a range of tricks, he used my jacket for one---the ubiquitous &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you think I&rsquo;ve put this knife through your nice jacket&rdquo; trick), and today's <em>Father's Day</em> extravaganza, featuring nice presents (<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/05/06/1019441476677.html">things</a> <a href="http://www.sidsaustralia.org.au/mos/vic/melbforkids/melbkids2.htm">to</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864367350/">read</a>) and a wonderful breakfast, and a Zachary who slept in until 7:30am!  Things are <em>OK</em>.</p>
