<p>The bugs aren't ironed out yet, but I've enjoyed playing around with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical">iCal</a>, and <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> in order to automatically send my <a href="http://consequently.org/logic-seminars/logic-seminars.ics">calendar of logic seminars</a> (maintained locally on my own computer in my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/">diary</a>) to a <a href="http://consequently.org/logic-seminars/">web page which announces them to the world</a>.  It's not quite finished yet, but it gives you an idea of what we're doing.</p>
