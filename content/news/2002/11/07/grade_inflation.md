<p>I sometimes complain about <em>grade inflation</em>, the phenomenon of too many students being given high grades.  According to Alfie Kohn (<a href="http://www.alfiekohn.org/">whose work</a> I respect) <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i11/11b00701.htm">maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t worry so much</a>.</p>
