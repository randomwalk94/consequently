<p>More <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/10/1036308573168.html">reason</a> to be thankful that <a href="http://www.theage.com.au">The Age</a> publishes Peter Roebuck&rsquo;s commentary on the cricket too.  It makes breakfast newspaper reading enjoyable.  <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/10/1036308573168.html">Here is one example</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Lehmann will be popular with spectators because he is an antidote to the prevailing fashion, a throwback to the days of blue-collar cricketers. As far as this column knows, he spends his evenings reading long-winded novels, eating carrots and sipping fizzy water but he does manage to create the impression of a man with a more colourful range of recreational interests.
</blockquote>

<p>More&rsquo;s the pity that the cricket itself may not be able to sustain so much interest, with  contest <a href="http://abc.net.au/news/sport/cricket/2002/11/item20021110211921_1.htm">so uneven</a>.  I&rsquo;m glad that my tickets for the MCG test are for the second day, and not the fourth or fifth.</p>
