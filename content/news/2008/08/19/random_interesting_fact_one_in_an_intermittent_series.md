Out of the five Australians who were chosen as nominating editors of this year's [Philosophers' Annual](http://www.philosophersannual.org/), four are from [The University of Melbourne](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au).  The lucky 4 are Hazen, Schroeter (Fran&ccedil;ois), Schroeter (Laura), and Restall.  (The other Australian is David Chalmers.)  

4 out of 28 is a good strike rate (that's 1 in 7, if you're too lazy to do the mental arithmetic). This is a teensy bit higher than the representation of University of Melbourne Philosophers in the Whole Wide World.
