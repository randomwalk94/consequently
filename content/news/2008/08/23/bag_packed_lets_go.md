Bag packed, ticket & passport at the ready, [computer](http://apple.com/macbookpro) charged, [phone](http://apple.com/iphone) charged and synced, [books](http://www.amazon.com/Colossians-Remixed-Subverting-Brian-Walsh/dp/0830827382/consequentlyorg) to [read](http://www.amazon.com/dp/019536726X) located, papers to read/referee/assess all printed or downloaded.

I must be going on a flight.  The trip takes me from Melbourne to Singapore to Amsterdam to Tallinn to [Tartu](http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference), and then I retrace my steps to get back here in ten days.  That's too much plane and airport time for my money, but I fully expect that [this](http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?program) will be worth the discomfort.  Oh, the day-and-a-bit stopover in Amsterdam should [be worth it too](http://rijksmuseum.nl/).
