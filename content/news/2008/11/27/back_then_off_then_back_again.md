My trip to Guangzhou was super.  Thanks, Guoxin, Min and Xuefeng for looking after me and showing me the sights of Guangzhou, and to Professors Ju and Zhu for the invitation.  It was a wonderful experience for me, and I look forward to many more visits to China, and to the <a href="http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/logic/english/Index.asp">Institute of Logic and Cognition</a>.

Since then, I've been off to Canberra for a little workshop on hyperintensionality, organised by David Chalmers.  Much fun was had there, too, but I must admit I'm even more confused than I was when I started.  It must have been all that talking to Max Cresswell, Lloyd Humberstone and John Bigelow about how semantics works.
