The primary purpose of this site seems to be travel announcements, so rather than break the trend, I'll post another travel announcement. On Sunday, I'm off to the [Institute of Logic and Cognition](http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/logic/english/Index.asp) at [Sun Yat-Sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.html), to [give three lectures on my research](http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/Article/xueshuxinxi/jididongtai/200811/681.html).  This is my first trip to China, so I'm more excited (and more nervous) than usual for an overseas trip.
