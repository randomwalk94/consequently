I'm off to Tartu in late August, for what looks like a [really fun conference](http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference) on logical pluralism.  The [list of speakers](http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?speakers) is extraordinarily high-powered.  Having so many smart people talk about logical pluralism is exciting, and not a little bit scary.  

If you're interested in coming along, [let the organisers know by July 1](http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?register).  If you're interested in the state of the art on logical pluralism, this conference is the place to be.

Thanks, [Daniel](http://daniel.cohnitz.de), [Marcus](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~mr30/) and [Peter](http://people.su.se/~ppagin/pagineng.htm) for organising this.  It's going to be my highlight of the second half of the year.
