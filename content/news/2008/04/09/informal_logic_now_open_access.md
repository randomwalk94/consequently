The journal *[Informal Logic](http://informallogic.ca)*, on argumentation theory and related issues, is now open access and online, after a 27 year history as a print (closed access) journal.    The editors have sent out a request for interested parties to subscribe.  Subscription is free: just [fill in this form on the site](http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/user/register). The editors are aiming get enough subscribers to secure funding from the [SSHRC](http://sshrc.ca) to keep the journal going now that they're not taking paid subscriptions.

This is a worthy goal: the more [open access journals](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl), [the better](http://semprag.org)! So, if you're at all interested in argumentation theory and informal logic, please [sign up](http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/user/register).
