It's Christmas break here, and I'm taking a break, with visits from family and friends, and then a trip to the USA for a holiday (and for a couple of little side trips to see friends and give a few talks).  More about that in a little while.

To share the Christmas spirit, I'll share a favourite carol:

> The tree of life my soul hath seen,  
> Laden with fruit and always green:  
> The trees of nature fruitless be  
> Compared with Christ the apple tree.  
> 
> His beauty doth all things excel:  
> By faith I know, but ne'er can tell  
> The glory which I now can see  
> In Jesus Christ the apple tree.  
>
> For happiness I long have sought,   
> And pleasure dearly I have bought:  
> I missed of all; but now I see  
> &rsquo;Tis found in Christ the apple tree.  
>
> I'm weary with my former toil,  
> Here I will sit and rest awhile:  
> Under the shadow I will be,  
> Of Jesus Christ the apple tree.  
>
> This fruit doth make my soul to thrive,  
> It keeps my dying faith alive;  
> Which makes my soul in haste to be  
> With Jesus Christ the apple tree.  

The plan is to reboot the blog (and to fix the comment system, which is down for the count just now) for 2009.  We'll see how we go with that.
