(These are entries from my blog from 2000 and early 2001. They were originally hosted on a small server at <a href="http://mq.edu.au">Macquarie University</a>. Most of the links are dead now, but I have kept them as they are here, for nostalgia&rsquo;s sake.)

     OK.  Just a <em>little</em> browsing while the cake is baking.  <a href="http://www.hermenaut.com/">Hermenaut</a> is an interesting browse: philosophers outside academia.

     Quiet day today.  Baking a cake, writing a paper, and having people over for dinner &amp; supper.  No more blogging today.

     This afternoon's listening is <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/music/planet/planet.htm">The Planet</a> with <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/employment/9810/10/employment2.html">Lucky Oceans</a>.  Certainly my favourite voice on radio.  Rich and mellow.

     This morning's listening: <a href="http://www.ecmrecords.com/ecm/recordings/1591.html">Alina</a>.  <a href="http://www.ecmrecords.com/ecm/artists/111.html">Arvo P&amp;auml;rt</a> is my composer of choice at present.  Divine simplicity.

     I have been enjoying taking pictures more on my last trip, but I don't particularly like my camera.  Some people have been pointing to the idiosyncratic <a href="http://www.lomo.com/">lomo camera</a>.  But then there are those digital things.  Who knows.

     I <em>really</em> like the <a href="http://www.powazek.com/">powazek</a>
redesign.  It is clear and clean, and <em>personally</em> I prefer my sites I regularly visit to be frame-free.

     The <a href="http://www.remogeneralstore.com/index.cfm?sponsor=0003332">REMO General Store</a> is soon open for business.  Remo was a <em>big thing</em> here in Sydney, until they went out of business a few years ago.  Now, the phoenix emerges from the ashes, bigger and better -- and now on the net!  
They stock the best <a href="http://www.remogeneralstore.com/alpha/product.cfm?pk=63">t-shirts</a>, <a href="http://www.remogeneralstore.com/alpha/product.cfm?pk=121">coffee</a> and <a href="http://www.remogeneralstore.com/alpha/random.cfm">just about anything</a>.

     <a href="http://www.phil.mq.edu.au/staff/grestall/rlinks.html">Greg Restall | Research Links</a> is my research links page.  I have been updating it lately, cleaning up the design; weeding out dead links; adding newer ones and categorising everyone.  It's work, but it makes the page more useable.
