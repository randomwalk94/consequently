Here is today's quiz question.  Which master of exposition said *this*, and where?

> After arguing for years, unconvincingly, that semantic value (properly understood) is not affected by substitution, I hit upon a brilliant, new, and completely successful, strategy: argue, instead, that semantic value *is* affected by substitution.

Here's a _hint_: the quote occurs after in the context of a discussion of proper names. 

(Upon reflection, that's not much of a hint, is it?)

Post your guess as to who I'm quoting, in the [comments form on this post](http://consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today).  (You can post an informed answer too, if you like, but I suspect a guess would be even more fun.)  The most interesting answer will receive a _prize_ in the honest-to-goodness snail mail.
