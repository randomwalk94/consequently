Whoever thought that teaching in three subjects, chairing one committee, participating in another one with a honking big project to keep on the rails for the next few months, supervising _n_ research students (for a seriously large value of '_n_') and trying to keep your research ticking over would keep you busy with work?  I did think that.  But now I know it by acquaintance, and not merely by dispassionate theoretical reflection.

Anyway, I'm not here to moan.  I'm here to make you an offer.

My friend, colleague, [co-author](http://consequently.org/writing/pluralism) (more like partner in crime) [Jc Beall](http://web.me.com/jcbeall/Site/Home.html) has gone and written _another_ book _[Spandrels of Truth](http://www.amazon.com/Spandrels-Truth-Jc-Beall/dp/0199268738/consequentlyorg)_.  (He's one of these ridiculously prolific authors.)  Anyway, it's a cracker of a read, on the view that if we take seriously the idea that to say that <_p_> is true is no more and no less than to say that _p_, then the inconsistencies like the liar paradox are side-effects of the 'design' decisions, just like [spandrels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel) in architecture, and are neither to be worried about nor gotten rid of: instead, they're to be lived with.  Jc's job is to convince us all of this by supplying us a paraconsistent logic and enough semantic machinery to show that living with them is not going to make the whole building fall down.  I think he does a great job, and that this book is required reading for anyone thinking about theories of truth, paradoxes and stuff like that.

Thankfully, the required reading is not too expensive.  Use [this form](http://consequently.org/temp/Spandrels.pdf) for your ordering, and Oxford University Press will shave 20% off the price.  Go buy it.  Help Jc rocket up the best-seller lists.  But be quick. The 20% discount lasts only until June 11, 2009.
