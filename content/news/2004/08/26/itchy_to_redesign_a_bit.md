I've been feeling like redesigning this site, yet again.  There's a lot about the design here I like, yet it's not quite *right* for some of what I want to do.  If you have any likes or dislikes about this place, please leave a comment here.  I've got some ideas of what the redesign might feature, but I don't want to get rid of anything that my three regular readers appreciate.
