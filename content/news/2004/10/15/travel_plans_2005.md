In the second half of 2005 we're planning to travel, on sabbatical.  The C, G and Z show will be based in Oxford for [Michaelmas](http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/ox/terms.html).  

Before arriving in Oxford, we'll be doing some European touring.  C will be visiting a colleague in Denmark.  I'll hopefully be presenting at *[Logic Colloquium 2005](http://eudoxos.math.uoa.gr/~lc2005/)* in Athens (July 28 to August 3), and *[ESSLLI2005](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/)* in Edinburgh (I should be on in the second week, August 15 to 19).
