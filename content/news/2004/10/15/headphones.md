One stroke of good fortune today.  In a shopping trip with Z this afternoon, while looking for a *Super Secret Present* at [JB Hi-Fi](http://jbhifi.com.au/) I found a set of [Sennheiser HD 497](http://www.headphone.com/layout.php?topicID=3&subTopicID=26&productID=0020080497)s on sale.  Picking these [sweet](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000065BPC/consequentlyorg) [headphones](http://www.epinions.com/Sennheiser_HD_497_Headphones_Headphones/display_~reviews) up for $15 was very very nice.

Especially considering that this was approximately 80% off the list price.

Oh, and they're very nice headphones.
