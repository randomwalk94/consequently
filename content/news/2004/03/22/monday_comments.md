1. On Saturday night I went to see <a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/fogofwar/">Fog of War</a> with my brother-in-law, who is visiting Melbourne for a few days.  I was absolutely knackered (must have been something to do with staying up until 1:30 that morning getting the <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/logical_pluralism/">book</a> away to the publisher), but I managed to stay conscious for 95% of the movie.

    It was a striking movie in a number of different ways. One I haven't seen mentioned in any of the reviews I read before the movie was the beautiful <a href="http://rgable.typepad.com/aworks/2004/01/the_fog_of_war_.html">Philip Glass soundtrack</a>.  It suited the movie down to the ground.

2. It's nice to see <a href="http://consequently.org/news/2004/03/18/publishing_a_book">discussion on book publishing</a> continuing.  I have 11 comments, over half of whom are written by people who are not me.  I like having smart readers who have opinions and are able to articulate them.

3. At [Toby](http://www.amirrorclear.net/)'s prompting, I've been stuffing around with the [stylesheet](http://consequently.org/2004.css) for this page. He thought (and I'm inclined to agree) that the background colour between the different content rectangles was too "white."  I've changed it, but I don't like the result either.  As of today it's #eff8d1.   Any takers for a better background colour?

4. A corridor discussion with Allen Hazen this morning about permission statements, prompted by the well-known observation that when we say "you can do *X* or *Y*" we really mean "you can do *X* and you can do *Y*", led me to show that (under certain assumptions) there *is* a two-place connective (call it 'erk') such that "you can do *X* erk *Y*" is equivalent to "you can do *X* and you can do *Y*."  It's just that "erk" is not disjunction.

    Now I'm in two minds as to what to do.  I want to write this up for public consumption, and this is a nice place to do it.  But I also think that setting that topic as an assignment question for my [Non-Classical Logic class](http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161212/pub/) would be most appropriate.  It would be simple to do both, except that I'm confident that some of my students in Non-Classical Logic read this site. (Hi guys!)  

    So, what should I do?  Post here?  Set it as an assignment?  Both?  Neither?
