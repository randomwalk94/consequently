This site has been sitting fallow for eleven months.  That's far too long in short-attention web land, so no doubt I've lost my vast readership.  It's time to reboot it, so here we go.  There are a few changes that have been on my mind for some time.  
</p>
<ul>
<li> The <em>look</em>. Tired of white, tired of websafe colours, I've gone to earth tones for a change.  Sterility be gone!  I've only checked in a couple of different browsers, so let me know if there are any bugs.</li>
<li> I've succumbed to weblog-ism just a little.  I've swapped the news section with one of the sidebars, mainly so that I can post more photos in the "News" section of the site without the restriction to a 250 pixel width in the right column.  Now I have more options, and I might just post more pictures here.  It should also give me room to post more <em>philosophy</em> here, like all the <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/tar/">cool</a> <a href="http://www.umsu.de/wo/index.php">kids</a> are doing.</li>
<li> I've upgraded to the latest version of <a href="http://movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> to run this thing.  I've also decided to turn on comments on the <em>News</em> section of the site and one other part&nbsp;...</li>
<li> ...&nbsp;which is the <em>major</em> change around here.  I've recoded the publications section of the site: <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/">consequently.org/writing</a> is now your one-stop-repository for everything academic of mine to hit print.  This used to be a pain to code by hand, and when I caught wind of <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2003/07/16/rebuilding_a_portfolio.html">examples</a> out there of people using weblog software to power a portfolio site, I thought that it might work for my publications page.  It's pretty neat the way it works from my side.  Every article/draft/book is a "blog entry" of its own, with a title, publication or draft date, abstract, pointer to a <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> file of the paper (if it exists), and its own <em>comment area</em>.  That means readers like you can comment on anything I've written in the one place where other web browsing readers are likely to find it.  Not that you'd necessarily want to comment on what I've written, but I like feedback, and maybe <em>some</em> of you will feel moved to comment.  I'll be interested to see what it means when it comes to paper drafts, and the <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/pc/">Next Book Project</a>, for which I plan to post draft chapters as they're written.</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, sit back, relax, leave a comment, download some <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/">papers</a>, subscribe to the <a href="http://consequently.org/news/index.xml">three</a> <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/index.xml">RSS</a> <a href="http://consequently.org/snippets/index.xml">feeds</a>, and wait for the next update!
