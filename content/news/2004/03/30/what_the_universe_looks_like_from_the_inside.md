The mathematically/logically/physically minded among you should take a look at "[The internal description of a causal set: What the universe looks like from the inside](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9811053 "[gr-qc/9811053]")" by [Fotini Markopoulou](http://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/researchers/view_bio.cfm?id=18).  (Found from a reference to in [two](http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Two%20Approaches%20to%20Modelling%20the%20Universe.pdf) [papers](http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Causal%20sets%20and%20Frame-Valued%20Set%20Theory.pdf) by [John Bell](http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell), which was found in turn by way of [Brian Weatherson](http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/tar/Archives/002689.html).)  This is interesting, deep material at the intersection between the semantics for non-classical logics and difficult physics.

Some [handwritten slides](http://cgpg.gravity.psu.edu/online/Html/Seminars/Fall1998/Markopoulou/Slides/s01.html) are available for a talk she gave on the topic.  Handwritten slides from talks given by mathematicians or physicists are often very revealing: they present the flavour of the material succinctly and often with flair and character.  Will this survive the transition to digital production of slides?
