If I post anything here between now and Easter, consider yourself lucky.  Christine (my omnicompetent spouse) is enjoying well-earned time away from the house while taking a research/conference/catch-up-with-friends trip to London, Oxford and Glasgow.  I, therefore, am enjoying even more time with my son.

It follows that any posts here are either the result of sheer good fortune or a sign of excessive procrastination.
