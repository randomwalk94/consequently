An interesting collection.  Bruce Cockburn is over-represented considering that he's only 609.4MB out of 14.57GB, but perhaps he has a thing for the wind.

[Note added on March 17: In the original post I had  the albums of the two Bruce Cockburn songs around the wrong way.  Not that any of us noticed, or anything.]
