Here's a research project for you.  Look at the physical interpretation of intuitionistic logic in the Markopoulou and Bell papers I [mentioned yesterday](http://consequently.org/news/2004/03/30/what_the_universe_looks_like_from_the_inside), mix in Nuel Belnap's really interesting account of an indeterministic relativistic universe in "[Branching Space-time](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001003/)" and the Thomason point/history semantics for temporal logic motivated and justified in Belnap and Green's wonderful [Indeterminism and The Thin Red Line](http://www.people.virginia.edu/~msg6m/trl.pdf "A 2.9MB PDF file: download at your peril"), and stir thoroughly.

Let me know what you cook up.  I think it could be really *interesting*.  In fact, you could come [here](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/) as a graduate student and do a project just like this one.  This would be a great M.A. or Ph.D. thesis topic.
