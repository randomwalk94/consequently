I've been rather busy for the last little while, as the absence from the website might indicate.  Here is a list of what's been happening, which involves not a little bit of trumpet-blowing, because a lot of the news has been good and it's time for me to share.

* Last week I spent an enjoyable (if rather *wet*) week in Canberra, touring the sights with Zachary in the mornings, and teaching at [Logic Summer School](http://lss.rsise.anu.edu.au/) in the afternoons.  Going through a rapid-fire course covering Turing machines, register machines, recursive functions, the halting problem, diagonalisation, formal arithmetic, representability, and G&ouml;del's incompleteness results in 5 hours flat was a challenge.  I learned something setting it up and I hope the students learned something in the listening.  (They laughed at my jokes, which was very polite.)

* While I was looking after Z, C was at a [conference](http://regnet.anu.edu.au/events/GovNet_RegNet_Conf/announcement.htm), at which her [most recent book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0199264074/consequentlyorg) had its Australian launch.  Z and I crashed the launch party at [University House](http://www.anu.edu.au/unihouse), which was great fun.  

* Immediately upon our return to Melbourne, we went to some [friends' wedding](http://www.livingroom.org.au/blog/archives/livingroom_wedding_1.php) up near Marysville. The drive through [Black Spur](http://www.visitvictoria.com/displayObject.cfm/objectid.00064EAD-739A-1EF6-9E6080C476A90000/vvt.vhtml) would have been nice in and of itself. The touching wedding ceremony and socialising with friends out in attractive country was almost an excellent bonus.

* Before going away I heard three bits of good news.  First, I'm now on the editorial board of the [*Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic*](http://projecteuclid.org/ndjfl).  (My membership doesn't seem to be on their website as yet, but it should be sometime soon.)  This was the site of my [first academic publication](http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp), so I'm chuffed to be on the editorial board now.  Send good papers to the journal.  It's a great print journal with an enlightened open access policy for its [archive](http://projecteuclid.org/ndjfl) (you get free access to papers older than five years).  The online archive goes back to *1960*, which is seriously impressive.

* The last round of ARC research grants was announced a little while ago and my last application with Graham Priest and Allen Hazen received [funding in the current round](http://www.arc.gov.au/pdf/By_State-University_2005.pdf).  So, we're receiving support for our projects, which is nice.  

* Lastly, I have been elected as a Fellow of the [Australian Academy of the Humanities](http://www.humanities.org.au/).  The [citation](http://www.humanities.org.au/NewFellowsMediaRelease.PDF.pdf) says exaggeratedly flattering things about me.  Thanks to everyone who put my name forward.  I'm chuffed.
