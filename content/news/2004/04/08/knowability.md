In between teaching, looking after Zack, keeping a house in order and occasionally getting some sleep, I am thinking about [Fitch's Knowability Paradox](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fitch-paradox/).  This thinking seems to be turning into a little paper entitled "Not Every Truth Can Be Known: at least, not all at once."  I'll post the thing on this site as soon as it's a rough draft.
