The University administration made some [decisions today](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/highereducationreforms/) on funding and access changes for 2005.

There were student protests on campus today, over the decision.  The University's council chambers are in [our building](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/general/), and the building was locked down from 11:30 this morning, in preparation for the protests.  (We were asked to leave the building for the rest of the day.) The council met this afternoon, but, despite the security guards and police presence ringing the building, council met elsewhere.
