I've just heard that the *[AJL](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/)* will soon appear in the [DEST](http://www.dest.gov.au) *[Register of Refereed Journals](http://www.dest.gov.au/highered/research/herdc.htm#journals)*.  This makes me happy.

If *you* are an editor of a refereed journal, please take the time to get your journal registered on this list.  (It's not difficult.  The [submission process](http://www.dest.gov.au/highered/research/herdc.htm#journals) is straightforward.)  If you are on this list, then Australians who publish in your journal will not have to bug you for a letter indicating that your journal peer-referees its articles. (Why?  Because peer review makes an article *count* in DEST's scheme assigning brownie points for research output, which means more *money* for your institution, hence the need to prove it.) So, being on the register saves you, the journal editor (or your admin staff if you're lucky enough to have any, I suppose) time. 

Being on the register will also make you attractive to Australian authors.  I note that precious few philosophy or journals are yet on the register.  Consider this a plea to get more on that list.
