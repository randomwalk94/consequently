Do you want to come to the [Melbourne Philosophy Department](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/) and teach my *[Reasoning and Uncertainty](http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161246/pub/)* course for me for Semester 2, 2004?  I've got some research money, and I'm using it to buy out some teaching to give me more time to *write*.  Check the [details](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/general/positions.html) if you're interested in applying for the position.  If you've got any questions, contact me.

There will also be tutoring positions in my *[Intro Logic](http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub/)* course too, though current postgraduates in the department are a high priority for these tutoring positions, and I *think* we've got enough candidates to fill every slot for the next time it's taught.
