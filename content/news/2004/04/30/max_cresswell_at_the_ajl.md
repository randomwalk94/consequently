I'm pleased to [point you](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/2004/) to the next article published in [our little ejournal](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/).  Max Cresswell's paper "[Possibility Semantics for Intuitionistic Logic](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/2004/index.html#2)" was uploaded earlier today.
