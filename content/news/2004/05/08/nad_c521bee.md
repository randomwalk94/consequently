Christine received an [early Mother's Day present](http://nadelectronics.com/cd_players/C521BEE_framset.htm).  The NAD C521BEE [sounds gorgeous](http://nadelectronics.com/reviews/C521BEE_0903_framset.htm).  A weclome bonus is that it plays every CD we feed it, unlike our dearly departed Yamaha CD player, which served us well for the last 10 years or so, but it started giving up the ghost (being very picky about what CDs it felt like playing) over the last couple of years.

Now if only our [receiver](http://207.228.230.231/info/NAD_701.pdf) would actually show us the frequency it's tuned to on its front panel!
