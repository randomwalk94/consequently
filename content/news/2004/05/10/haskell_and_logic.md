This looks very nice indeed: *[The Haskell Road](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jve/HR/)* is a textbook on elementary logic, mathematics and programming, based around my favourite programming language [Haskell](http://haskell.org).

I'm glad that this wasn't the textbook in my introductory computer science course, long ago in 1986.  If it were, I may have fallen in love with computing and never become a philosopher.

*Parenthetical remark 1*: How a textbook based on Haskell, a computer programming language that wasn't even [defined](http://haskell.org/haskell-history.html) in 1986 is a matter for counterfactual speculation.

*Parenthetical remark 2*: I did do a section on Miranda in a *Declarative Programming* course in my second year, in 1987.  I see [now](http://haskell.org/haskell-history.html) that this was pretty cutting-edge stuff.  By this time, however, the mystique of late night (and *all* night) debugging sessions had well-and-truly worn off, and I've become a philosopher, after a brief stint trying to become a mathematician instead.
