"[Not Every Truth Can Be Known](http://consequently.org/writing/notevery)" is now up to version 0.9, and it's having its first public beta test on Friday morning in the local logic seminar.  Come along (Cussonia Court Room 1, University of Melbourne, Friday 11am) and enjoy the ride if you like that kind of thing.

Christine reminded me that when talking about epistemic logic one should, of course, cite Donald Rumsfeld's [famous](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3254852.stm) (or *infamous*?) [remarks](http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Feb2002/t02122002_t212sdv2.html) about the known knowns, the known unknowns, and the unknown unknowns.  (Does the fact that he didn't mention the unknown knowns mean that he implicitly endorses the [KK thesis](http://www.google.com/search?q=kk+thesis)?  Who can tell?)

Anyway, [take a look at the paper](http://consequently.org/writing/notevery) (the changes from 0.85 to 0.9 are mainly bugfixes and exposition changes, no pictures yet, though I promise they will come *someday*) and [let me know what you think](http://consequently.org/writing/notevery).
