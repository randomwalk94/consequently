A long time ago, I wrote about a logician a day for a whole month.  The old location is a broken link now, and it's hard to retrieve it from there, so I've [reposted it](http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/).  Some of the old links (those to xrefer.com) don't work any more.  If you've got any comments or suggestions, don't hesitate to [post them there](http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/).
