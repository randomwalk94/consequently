This morning I had my first ever "parent/teacher interview," with Z's carers at childcare.  They seem to like him, and he generally likes them (though Z is choosy when it comes to who counts as his *friend*: the select group is pretty small at the moment).  So now I know how they take him to be going on emotional, social, cognitive and motor development.

And according to the carers (who have scales and developmental criteria and all of that kind of stuff) he's going pretty darn well.  So, I suppose we have passed this "test."
