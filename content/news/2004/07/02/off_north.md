This last couple of weeks has been super-busy-hectic.  Z and I fly up north this afternoon for a family visit.  On Sunday I go off to the [AAP Conference](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/aap2004/) at South Molle, and Z stays with his Granddad for a couple of days, to be joined by his mum who returns from her little Europe conference trip.

One piece of advice: If you're preparing a conference presentation with simple dot-and-line pictures, and you'd like them to be presented *dynamically*, then the LaTeX packages [beamer and pgf](http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/) [are your friends](http://consequently.org/papers/acdei_talk.pdf).
