I've just bought some sheet music for the first time in 18 years or so.  Let's hope my violin technique is up to [this](http://www.universaledition.com/truman/frontend/439_ue13360.pdf).  I know I can play the *notes* (or close approximations to them).  It's sustaining the technique for 10 minutes that I'm not so sure about.
