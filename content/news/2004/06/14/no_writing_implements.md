I never thought I'd comment on *Big Brother*, but when I [learned that the *inmates* aren't even allowed *writing implements* inside](http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/13/1087065031443.html?oneclick=true), I am convinced that the place is completely inhumane.  I can't imagine a life where I can't write, whether on paper or on the computer.

I suppose that the restriction serves a couple of goals of the producer.  (1) no passing notes from inmate to inmate: all communication must be picked up by the microphones. (2) no writing of diaries (and all that that entails).

Oh, hey, Merlin Luck's [protest](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/14/1087065042010.html) was great.  Good on him.
