Green*fleet*'s [Tree Totaller](http://www.greenfleet.com.au/signup/subscribe.asp) is a simple way to estimate your annual greenhouse emissions from your use of a car, your household and your air travel.  

As a household, we're running at an annual rate somewhere between 30 and 40 tonnes. (The indeterminacy here is chiefly due to my ignorance about the number of flights we're making this year.)  Our car useage is a pretty skimpy 1.8 tonnes.
