Here is my *favourite* paper of the last few years.  At last, I've finished wrestling with the diagrams in the paper and "[The Geometry of Non-Distributive Logics](http://consequently.org/writing/gndl/)" can now see light of day.  My superb and long-suffering co-author [Francesco Paoli](http://www.unica.it/~paoli/) and I have been working on this on-and-off since we met and talked about this material in the middle of 2001.  Francesco provided a great draft, which sat in my pile of things to do for altogether too long as I tried to get the diagrams to look legible.  Anyway, after some gentle reminding from Francesco, and after a few late nights and debugging [MetaPost](http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html) code, we've finished a draft of the paper.

It's the first completed technical work in the [proof project](http://consequently.org/writing/pc/), to go alongside [some](http://consequently.org/writing/assertiondenialparadox/) [of](http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/) [the](http://consequently.org/writing/lnclem/) [other](http://consequently.org/writing/adcei/) stuff I've been working on.

Comments are, as always, [most welcome](http://consequently.org/writing/gndl/).
