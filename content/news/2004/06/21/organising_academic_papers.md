Now *this* is a question which is much more sensible to ask than you might otherwise think: &ldquo;[Why can't I manage academic papers like MP3s?](http://freelancepropaganda.com/archives/MP3vPDF.pdf)&rdquo; (the link is to a pdf of a paper by James Howison and Abby Goodrum).

My "paper archive" is a fairly large 2GB (not as big as my "music archive", I suppose) with about 6000 papers, and it's catergorised under author (approx 2000 of those).  If anyone can produce a way that enables me to sort, label, filter, slice and dice these just as smoothly as [iTunes](http://apple.com/itunes/) does my mp3s, I'll be a very happy academic.
