[Assertion, Denial, Accepting, Rejecting,
Symmetry, Paradox, and all that](http://consequently.org/writing/assertiondenialparadox) (the paper with the ridiculously long name) has been given a few more paragraphs in preparation for an [outing](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/aap2004/).  Comments, as always [are welcome](http://consequently.org/writing/assertiondenialparadox).
