There's no accounting for musical taste.  This morning Z was a little upset. I decided to put on some music for him.  First selection: [Big Red Car](http://shop.abc.net.au/browse/product.asp?productid=341061).  

A little voice responds, with a tremor.  "Dad."

I ask, "Zack, what is it?"

"I don't want this on.  I want *your* music."

"OK." Takes CD out.  Replaces it.  "Is [this](http://www.ozmusiconline.com.au/product_info.php/cPath/190093_190083_190088_190076_190783/products_id/333046?osCsid=b22bab9d670495188ce4969e15349660) any better?"

He sounds much brighter.  "Good!"
