In case you were wondering where this site was over the last couple of days: it turns out that both of the domain name servers that were registered for this site are in *Florida*.  Not the best place to be over the last few days.

I've now got three DNS machines registered for this domain, and they're not all in the same continent, so hopefully it's more reliable now.
