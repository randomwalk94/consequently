<p>Sometimes it seems like there are too many thoughts to think and too little time in which to think them.  Here&rsquo;s an example: I really ought to think of a detailed response to <a href="http://philosophyweblog.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_philosophyweblog_archive.html#89228851">Brian Weatherson&rsquo;s comments</a> on <a href="http://consequently.org/papers/envelopes.pdf">my two envelopes paper co-authored with Graham</a>, but that detailed response will have to wait a little while.</p>
<p>However, let me write a little enigmatic response while it&rsquo;s on my mind:</p>

<!-- BREAK -->

<p>There is an ambiguity in asking whether one &lsquo;ought to switch&rsquo; or not.  One answer will depend on which action maximises expected utility, given the process which places money in each envelope.  Another will depend on which action maximises expected utility, given what I know about the process placing money in each envelope.  If the circumstance is as Brian describes (I have envelope A, and the process has resulted $n in A and either $(0.5)n or $2n in envelope B with equal likelihood), then switching will maximise utility expected in sense 2.  If I don&rsquo;t know whether I have envelope A or envelope B, and I <em>do</em> know that I have equal probability of having envelope A or having envelope B (and the rest of the process is as Brian describes), then we are indifferent between switching and keeping.</p>
<p>That seems right to me, but I can&rsquo;t confirm if that&rsquo;s the view of the <em>authors of the paper</em>, as we haven&rsquo;t met to talk about this one yet.  Graham <a href="http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/papers.php3">presented the paper at the ANU</a> (the subtitle <em>the definitive solution to the two-envelope paradox</em> was not my idea!) and we have some other comments to work through, too.</p>
<p>But I have other pressing business also in the queue, including the final touches on a grant application, referee&rsquo;s reports, overdue book reviews, a too big pile of email to read and preparation for upcoming lectures.</p>
