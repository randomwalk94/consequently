<p>Both <em>News</em> and <em>Snippets</em> sections have corresponding RSS feeds, which you can use with feedreaders like <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</em> or <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">AmphetaDesk</a>.  (Some of the five readers of this site already use these tools, but I never publicised the links.  Now you can all know they&rsquo;re there.)</p>
