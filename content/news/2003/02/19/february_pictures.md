<p>February pictures of Zachary are <a href="http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02.html">here</a>.  They were taken on our day trip to the Dandenongs with Uncle Martin.  Zachary was <a href="http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image3.html">pretty</a> <a href="http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image5.html">keen</a> on <a href="http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image6.html">that</a> <a href="http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image8.html">straw</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, and for us, Zack&rsquo;s come down with chicken-pox.  The photos are all pre-pox, so there are no pictures of spots.  Or of <em>fots</em> as he calls them.</p>
