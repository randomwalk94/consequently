<p>Details are out for the <a href="http://www.brunswickmusicfestival.com.au/">Brunswick Music Festival</a> for 2003.  Looks like it will be fun.  The Sensitive New Age Cowpersons (<a href="http://www.brunswickmusicfestival.com.au/viewDetail.php?show=7">gig details</a>, <a href="http://www.flyingcats.com.au/snacs/">their own site</a>) are good for a laugh.</p>
