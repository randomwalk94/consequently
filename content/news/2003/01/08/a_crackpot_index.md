<p>John Baez&rsquo;s <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html">Crackpot Index</a> seems to me to be a pretty good measure of the difficult to define phenomenon of crackpottedness.  Notice the relatively low cost of outright <em>inconsistency</em> compared to nearly everything else.  That warms my heart.</p>
