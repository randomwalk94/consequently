<p>Quantum mechanics is just plain <em>weird</em>.  I don&rsquo;t really understand it at all, partly because of the strange nature of the <em>probabilities</em> in QM.  They certainly seem to fit observation (so physicists say), but what do they <em>mean</em>?  Well, <em>it just might be</em> that they are traditional probabilities after all.  That is, <a href="http://www.phys.uu.nl/~thooft/">Gerard &rsquo;t Hooft</a> has proposed a new deterministic interpretation of QM which makes sense of all of the numbers.  <em>Nature</em> has an <a href="http://www.nature.com/nsu/030106/030106-6.html">elementary article</a> about it, and the <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/quant-ph/0212095">preprint</a> is available for the hard-core physicists among you.  It looks neat from here, but as I have said, I don&rsquo;t really understand the details.  Those of you who do, let me know: does this account avoid the <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/HiddenVariables.html">usual</a> <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/#hv">objections</a> to &ldquo;hidden variables&rdquo;?</p>
