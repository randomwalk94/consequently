<p>Mac OS X users might be interested in <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/fahrenba/meteo/meteo.html">Meteorologist</a>, a menubar or dock thingy which tells you current weather and forecasts for the locations you suggest.  Just the thing for me, as I'll be off in Dunedin at a <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/philosophy/hume/index.html">conference</a> next week.  At least I'll be prepared for the wet and cool weather.</p>
