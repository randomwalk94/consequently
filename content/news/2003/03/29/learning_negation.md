<p>Having a young child gives you lots of new examples about language learning and concept acquisition.  (It also provides you with many opportunities for experimentation, but I will set that to one side, for the moment.)  Here is one such example:</p>
<p>On Friday morning, I was changing Z&rsquo;s nappy and getting him dressed.  He was in a happy mood, and I asked him if he would like me to tickle him.  He said <em>no, no tickle</em>.  Not to be deterred, I asked him again, and he responded again in kind.  There is no doubt that children learn to <em>deny</em> and <em>refuse</em> very early in their development.  Children also learn <em>opposites</em> quite quickly too.  Z has mastered vary many pairs of opposites, and he knows how to use them to his own advantage.</p>
<p>But a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.</p>
<p>I asked Z again, rephrasing the question: <em>would you like a <strong>little</strong> tickle?</em>  Z knew that he wanted to deny this, and so he went for what he took to be the relevant opposite.</p>
<p><em>No, no, no! <strong>Big</strong> tickle!</em></p>
<p>With the tickling that followed, another lesson was learned.</p>
