This Tuesday, I'm going to a *party*: It's a launch for [Christine](http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/staff/Christine%20Parker)'s book *[Inside Lawyers' Ethics](http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Lawyers-Ethics-Christine-Parker/dp/0521546648/consequentlyorg)*, which she's coauthored with [Adrian Evans](http://www.law.monash.edu.au/staff/aevans.html) from Monash Law School.  The book will be launched by [Louise Sylvan](http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/414787), from the [ACCC](http://www.accc.gov.au/).  This party will be held at the Monash University Law Chambers in the city.

Congratulations, Christine and Adrian!

It seems to be the season for book launches.  [Simon Holt](http://simoncareyholt.typepad.com/)'s *God Next Door* is [launching on April 19](http://simoncareyholt.typepad.com/weblog/2007/03/god_next_door.html) and [Matt Carter](http://braininavat.net/)'s *Minds and Computers* is [launching on April 23](http://braininavat.net/weblog/archives/000407.html).

(Activity here on the site will be quiet as I attempt to plough through a big teaching load and rather too many work commitments...)
