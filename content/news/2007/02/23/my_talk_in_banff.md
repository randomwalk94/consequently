I've finished up the slides for my talk in [Banff](http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/).  If you're interested, the slides are available here

> [Modal Models for Bradwardine's Truth](http://consequently.org/papers/bradwardine-banff-talk.pdf) [1.3MB pdf]

It's a talk giving a modal logic interpretation for a medieval theory of truth due to Thomas Bradwardine, as it's reconstructed by [Stephen Read](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html).  This will hopefully help out Steve's [project](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/medieval.html), by providing tools for exploring the strength of this kind of theory of truth.

I'll write up an extended paper version of this after getting comments from the audience.  Since the audience contains people who know a heck of a lot more than me about truth and about modal logic, I'm a little more on the anxious side than usual for such things.  Wish me luck!
