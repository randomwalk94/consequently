I've arrived in a sunny and summery Prague.  The locals tell me they it's cooler than the unseasonably warm that it's been in the last few years, but it seems nicely summery for one who has come from a winter.  I'm now chatting in the office with [Timothy](http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&id_categoryNode=801), [Jarda](http://jarda.peregrin.cz/welcome.htm) and [Vladimir](http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&id_categoryNode=798), and monopolising Jarda's computer while the others do work preparing for the [conference](http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&id_categoryNode=852).
