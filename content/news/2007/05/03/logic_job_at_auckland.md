As I've said [before](http://consequently.org/news/2002/05/14/job_at_auckland/), logic jobs in Philosophy Departments are pretty rare.  Well, as [Richard mentioned earlier](http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/2007/04/logic-job-at-auckland-nz.html), there's a logic job in Philosophy at [Auckland](http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/departments/index.cfm?S=D_PHIL).  A little bird has told me that even though the deadline is close (May 18), they're keen to get the word out to get as many applicants as possible.  So, if you qualify (PhD or equivalent in philosophy, teaching experience, some research publications) then hop to it and apply.  The details are [here](http://www.vacancies.auckland.ac.nz/positiondetail.asp?p=5057).
