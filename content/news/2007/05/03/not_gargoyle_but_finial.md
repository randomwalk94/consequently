You [learn something new every day](http://consequently.org/news/2007/05/03/logic_job_at_auckland/#c24290).  What we mistakenly called [gargoyles](http://consequently.org/phonecam/Dragon%20finial,%20Brunswick%20West,%20shot%20taken%20April%2011,%202007.jpg) are actually _finials_. (I've corrected the caption on the [photo](http://consequently.org/phonecam/Dragon%20finial,%20Brunswick%20West,%20shot%20taken%20April%2011,%202007.jpg) -- in case you don't understand what Christine meant.)

Christine took that photo on a finial-photographing expedition with Zachary and a friend from his class in school, on Zachary's birthday a few weeks ago.
