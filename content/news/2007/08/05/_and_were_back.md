I've been back in Melbourne for a while.  The trip was very enjoyable, but I've returned to Melbourne with a chest bug, which has meant that I'm not quite up to full speed yet.  All non-essential activities (and alas, some essential ones, I fear) are progressing much more slowly than usual.

Here are some highlights of the trip.

* [Logica 2007](http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&id_categoryNode=852) with so many great people, and then exploring Prague, catching up with [Richard](http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/), and getting to know more Czech logicians.
* Overdosing on [Medieval logic in Bonn](http://www.illc.uva.nl/GPMR-LS1/), and especially talking over Bradwardine with [Stephen Read](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html).
* Exploring K&oslash;benhavn with Christine and Zachary.  It was my second visit there, and Christine's umpteenth, so it was a lot easier to get around given than we were more familiar with the place.
* Navigating our way on the trains and buses from &Aring;rhus to [Legoland in Billund](http://legoland.dk) with Zachary, and then enjoying all there was to see and do there. 
* Meeting everyone at [Logic Colloquium in Wroc&#322;aw](http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~pkowa/lc2007.html) -- and especially thinking through -- with Pavel Pudl&aacute;k, Albert Visser, Alasdair Urquhart and Vedran &#x10C;a&#x10D;i&#x107; -- a counterexample to a conjecture of Grzegorczyk's.  The result of our thinking is [here](http://www.math.cas.cz/~pudlak/strings/doku.php?id=a_counterexample_to_a_conjecture_of_grzegorczyk).  Most of the thinking got done in a hike in the hills near Wroc&#322;aw.
* Flying back home with Z. Normally he finds the in-flight entertainment much more attractive than mundane activities such as sleep.  This can sometimes cause difficulty, especially when flying in to an airport for a quick change of planes, and we have a tired unhappy boy to navigate through the system.  This time, however, he slept well on both flights (Frankfurt to Singapore and Singapore to Melbourne), and we managed to get back home with very little jetlag.

So, a good time was had by all.  It's good to be back, even if we have to struggle through a bit more of winter here.  At least [our AFL team](http://lions.com.au) is performing [better](http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/lions-pile-on-the-pressure-in-finals-bid/2007/08/04/1185648222098.html) [than](http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/lions-in-flagcontender-form-matthews/2007/07/30/1185647829342.html) [expected](http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/rfmatchreport/pies-have-no-answers-against-roaring-lions/2007/07/28/1185339332180.html), so we might be able to cope with the end of the season here in football-mad Melbourne.
