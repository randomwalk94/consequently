I gave a talk on Logic in Australia at [Monash University's *Arts in Action* festival](http://arts.monash.edu.au/news-and-events/artsinaction07/program.php) in early June.  (This was a part of a long-running project on a [History of Australasian Philosophy](http://arts.monash.edu.au/phil/research/history/grant8.html).  The talk is now appearing, in two parts, on the (wonderful) ABC Radio National program, *[The Philosopher's Zone](http://abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/)*.  The first part was broadcast this weekend, but the audio can be downloaded from their [website](http://abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2007/1992998.htm) for the next four weeks.  That was the first half of the talk, on possible worlds.  The second half, on paraconsistency, will be broadcast next week.

In the talk, I made heavy use of digital projection.  I think you can follow the talk without it, but if you want to see the pretty pictures and diagrams, you can download the slides of the talk here:

* [Logic in Australia.mov](http://consequently.org/papers/Logic%20in%20Australia.mov) 22.5MB Quicktime file.  (Navigate it by clicking or by using the arrow keys.)
* [Logic in Australia.pdf](http://consequently.org/papers/Logic%20in%20Australia.pdf) 3.3MB PDF file. (This does not have all of the fancy transitions in the quicktime file.)
* [Logic in Australia.key.zip](http://consequently.org/papers/Logic%20in%20Australia.key.zip) 3.8MB compressed keynote file. (This has all the fancy transitions, and is the original document, but it requires Apple's [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/) presentation program to view.)
