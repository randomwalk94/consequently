Are you an undergraduate student in philosophy, or do you know any undergraduate philosophy students?  If so, you might be interested in the *Melbourne Philosophy Undergraduate Workshop* to be held from September 21 to 23.   This will be a chance for Australian and New Zealand undergraduate students who are interested in philosophy, to get together to talk philosophy with the faculty here at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au).  Given that we have a broad range of interests, from Continental and Asian Philosophy, through Ethics and Social Philosophy, Philosophy of Science, to Metaphysics and Logic, this will be a fun weekend. 

The deadline for applying for a grant to come to the workshop is coming up very soon: it's **August 15**.  For more details of how to be involved, read on...

<!-- BREAK -->

During the weekend of September Friday 21 to Sunday 23,
Melbourne University's [School of Philosophy](http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au) will host the _Melbourne
Philosophy Undergraduate Workshop_, aimed at
third and fourth year students who intend to continue in any branch of academic
philosophy. 

*Friday evening* will begin with a Welcome Meeting followed by
dinner on Lygon Street, Carlton. 

On *Saturday*, Melbourne faculty members will give presentations and/or lead seminars on a range of topics -- from Continental and Asian Philosophy, through Philosophy of Science, to Metaphysics and Logic. Saturday evening, another dinner on Lygon Street with more discussion.

On *Sunday*, each student will give a 15-or-so minute philosophy presentation, followed by 10 minutes for questions and discussion. This will continue after lunch until, satiated, we disperse to downtown Melbourne or wherever.

Ten particularly talented 3rd year and Honours students from across Australasia will be invited. Their transportation expenses will be covered up to $400, with a possibility of greater funds for students from Western Australia and New Zealand. Melbourne Philosophy will provide college accommodation for three nights, September 21 through 23.

Interested students should submit a transcript, along with a letter discussing their philosophical interests and, if possible, an abstract of their presentation talk. A short letter of reference from a faculty member is also required. Deadline: **15 August 2007**.
