Phew!  We're back in Oxford, and arrived in our house today.  We're in a cute little 2 bedroom house in the northern outskirts of Oxford, a quick busride down Banbury Road into Wolfson or the centre of town.  I'm currently dealing with some of the backlog of email in a Starbucks (of all places!) with a wireless network.  The week at Iona was *great*.  I'll write an extended post about it in a little while.  For now I have lots of other things to do to make the cute little house a bit more like a *home*, and figuring out how to best use my worktime for the best mix of reading, writing, going to seminars, giving talks, etc., etc.  (That and figuring out how I'll live without internet access at home.)

More later.
