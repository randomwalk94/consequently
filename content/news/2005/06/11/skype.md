Next travel thing: I've signed up at [skype.com](http://skype.com) and I have an account to make super-cheap voice calls home and almost anywhere else from the computer while overseas at least, when I'm connected to the internet.  It looks very well executed.  There are clients for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux, and at 1.7 euro cents a minute for calls to any landline (it's a bit more expensive to call mobiles) in Western Europe, North America and Aus/NZ, it is a very good deal.  Then there's the fact that it's free if you're making a Skype-to-Skype call.  If I were a [telecommunications company making money from traditional telephony](http://telstra.com), I think I'd be worried.

Anyway, if you've got a Skype account, let me know.  Look me up in the Skype directory to get my username.
