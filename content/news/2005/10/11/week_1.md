We're now in the second day of "week 1" of Michaelmas, here in Oxford, and the philosophy faculty library is *considerably* busier than it was in week 0, let alone the *negative* weeks.  It's just as well that I've got some writing done already.  Today I'm heading off to [Nottingham](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/) to give two talks.  The [Philosophy Department](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/philosophy) will get the first outing of my fresh-off-the-presses paper *[Invention is the Mother of Necessity](http://consequently.org/writing/invention)* in which I try out a (new, I hope) semantically anti-realist account of metaphysical necessity and possibility.  Have a look at [the paper](http://consequently.org/writing/invention) and let me know what you think, if you're into that sort of thing.  I'll be presenting it also in [Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/Philosophy/index.html), [St. Andrews](http://st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/) and [here in Oxford](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sann1762/Jowett.html), so it will probably see signifiant modifications and updates over the next months.  The other talk is the formal partner of that one, on proof theory for S5.  I'm still writing the notes up for this (we'll see how much I can get written on the train today), and I'll upload that when I can.

Then, with these papers largely written, I can get back to the [book](http://consequently.org/edit/page/Proof_and_Counterexample)!  I'm looking forward to it.
