I sometimes catch the tram to get to or from the office, and usually it's a not unpleasant experience.  

This evening was not one of the usual reasonably relaxing fifteen minute trips down Flemington Road and through Royal Park.  It's remarkable how a violent scuffle between passengers can change the feeling throughout the tram.  There was pushing, shoving, curses and epithets, clutching at throats, and a tense standoff from the protagonists. Shocked stares, shy glances away, pleas of "calm down!", "watch out!", and "cool it!" from the onlookers.  After the protagonists got off there were relieved sighs, a few tears, and a tram full of not-quite-returning-to-nomal people.
