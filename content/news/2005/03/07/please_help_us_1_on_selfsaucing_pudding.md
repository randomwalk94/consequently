Here's one thing I find comments on a website really good for: trawling for information.

My spouse and I were talking over dessert this evening, over some *lemon delcious pudding* that she had made.  She asked the question she asks every couple of years (when a self saucing pudding is made):

> How do self-saucing puddings work?

They really are miraculous, and we haven't got much of an idea of how the chemistry of these things makes them work.  A [cursory Googling](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22how+self-saucing+pudding+works%22) reveals *nothing*, and neither does a quick flick through *[On Food and Cooking](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684800012/consequentlyorg)*.  

Can you help us?
