At <a title="logicandlanguage.net: On Comments" href="http://www.logicandlanguage.net/archives/2005/03/on_comments_1.html#more">logicandlanguage.net</a> the author talks a little bit about <a title="logicandlanguage.net: On Comments" href="http://www.logicandlanguage.net/archives/2005/03/on_comments_1.html#more">comments on weblogs</a>.  On why one might allow them, or do without them. As you can see, I leave comments open here.  (Behind the scenes there is a <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">hardworking comment spam filter</a>.  Without that, this place would be deluged with spam.)

I can understand why one would want the place to yourself and do without comments.  However, if you do, and if you want your readers to *email you* (as the author of <a title="logicandlanguage.net: On Comments" href="http://www.logicandlanguage.net/archives/2005/03/on_comments_1.html#more">logicandlanguage.net</a> does) then *please* let the reader know your email address.
