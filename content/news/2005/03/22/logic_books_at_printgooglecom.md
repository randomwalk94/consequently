I think that Google's new [search-inside-the-book](http://print.google.com) service will prove to be quite handy to a researcher like me.  It's not satisfactory to read through a book like that on the screen (especially when copyright restrictions do not permit you to keep going after a couple of pages of continuous reading), but it will be a boon to research to be able to search inside the [book](http://print.google.com/print?id=8u-IU3xTHrcC)  for [everywhere lattices are mentioned](http://print.google.com/print?q=lattice&ie=UTF-8&id=8u-IU3xTHrcC).  

I like the idea so much I'm setting up a <a title="consequently.org/edit: Logic Books at print.google.com" href="http://consequently.org/edit/page/Logic_Books_at_print.google.com">list of logic-related books</a> on [my wiki](http://consequently.org/edit/page).  Feel free to browse the list, and to add to it any other logic-related works you find on [print.google.com](http://print.google.com).
