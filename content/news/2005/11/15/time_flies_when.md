... you're on sabbatical.  

I'm now in [St. Andrews](http://www.st-and.ac.uk/) visiting [Arch&eacute;](http://www.st-and.ac.uk/~arche/) for what can only be described as "November Madness."  I'm giving a [seminar](http://consequently.org/writing/invention) this afternoon in Arch&eacute;/Philosophy (in the wonderful [Edgecliffe](http://consequently.org/phonecam/Edgecliffe,%20St.%20Andrews,%20November%2015,%202005.jpg) building) and then tomorrow, I'm giving a [seminar](http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets) in [computer science](http://www.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/) tomorrow.  This means I'll miss the [Vagueness Seminar](http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Arche/VaguenessSeminar16Nov2005) and a [Philosophy Departmental Colloquium](http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Dept/EventRegister).  However, I will be at the [Revenge Workshop](http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Arche/ParadoxWorkshop) on Thursday, and the [Vagueness Workshop](http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Arche/VaguenessWorkshop5) for Friday and Saturday.

That should be enough to keep me going.
