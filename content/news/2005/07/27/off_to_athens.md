I'm off to Athens tomorrow.  Tonight I catch the train to K&oslash;benhavn, where I stay overnight in a cheap hotel near the airport, to get my 7:30am flight. [Logic Colloquium 2005](http://www.math.uoa.gr/lc2005) looks like it will be lots of fun.  I've been busy writing slides, and I should use the time on the train to put the finishing touches on Day 2. Once they're done, I'll post them on the [wiki page](http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005).  If you're coming to Athens, feel free to post things up on [that wiki page](http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005).
