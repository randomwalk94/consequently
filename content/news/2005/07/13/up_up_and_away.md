We fly later today!  The big study leave adventure starts later this afternoon.  The first few weeks alternate holidays and work for Christine and for me, and it gives us lots of time to enjoy the company of our young son.  Zachary and I are especially looking forward to [Legoland in Billund](http://www.lego.com/legoland/billund/) and exploring the surrounds of &Aring;rhus.

Our apartment apparently has an internet connection (I have no idea what kind, as of yet) so I'll hopefully be able to post photos and comments here to keep you up to date from time to time.
