Remind me to check legroom on airlines before I book them for the first time -- especially if I'm planning to write on the plane.  Maersk Airlines has an interesting policy of offering seats in S/M/L sizes.  S seats have a tight pitch of 29 inches (73-and-a-bit centimetres).  You can upgrade to a roomier seet for a price--a fact that the stewards make clear repeatedly on the flight itself.

I am *very* pleased that I got a seat in an otherwise empty row of three in an otherwise packed cabin. Another person asked to move into one of them, and between us, we had the middle seat to stretch our legs just a little and open my laptop.  (This is also the one occasion in which a 12inch Powerbook has a distinct advantage over my 17inch model.)
