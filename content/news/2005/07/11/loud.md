Sometimes music is best heard *at volume*.  A case in point?  The second movement of Shostakovich's *String Quartet No. 8*.  I recommend the [Fitzwilliam String Quartet recording](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000042HV/consequentlyorg).  (The Emerson Quartet's recording is [available on iTunes](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=7300788&selectedItemId=7300697), but the Fitzwilliams' isn't.)

(Apologies to our next door neighbours.  I'm enjoying my last bout of loud music at home before we travel and don't have access to a [decent sound system](http://consequently.org/news/2004/05/08/nad_c521bee/).)

That is all.
