We're settled in &Aring;rhus now, while Christine does work with a [colleague](http://www.ps.au.dk/showpage.asp?lNobuffer=1&lPageID=86) on a research project.  This gives Z and me lots of time for lots of fun.  Yesterday's fun was [Legoland](http://www.lego.com/legoland/billund/) (Vibeke and Christine wanted to come too, so we all made a day of it).  Z loved the rides, and the displays, and the Lego for sale.  We bought a [set](http://shop.lego.com/RetiredProducts.asp?p=4402) for him to grow into.  There's lots of fiddly pieces, but we've already managed to make [one of the models](http://consequently.org/phonecam/Zachary%20and%20a%20Lego%20creation,%20July%2019,%202005.jpg) together. (He does the putting together and I help find the pieces for him.)

More later.  I'm going to cook some dinner now.
