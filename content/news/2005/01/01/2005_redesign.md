My redesign for 2005 is in progress now.  After some problems (I managed to delete the [writing](http://consequently.org/writing/) page in a fit of cutting-and-pasting) I have some things on the way.  There are lots of changes behind the scene.  The linklist in the right column is now powered by [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us), which is wonderful.  The sidebars (left and right) contain other information, such as recent comments, recent udates on the [writing](http://consequently.org/writing/) page, and a little diary of events, past and present. Figuring out what goes where is all done automatically by the [weblog software I use](http://movabletype.org).  I hope you find the new design of the front page useful.  

Unfortunately, I've only got the front page working as of tonight, and it's time for me to get to bed.  The rest will come soon.  

Please let me know if the front page has any bugs when viewed in your browser.  Leave a message in the comments.

I do hope that your 2005 is a fruitful one.  If there's [something you can do](http://www.unicef.org.au/Donate-Appeals-Detail.asp?AppealID=7) to respond to the crisis in the wake of the tsunami crisis, then [do it](http://www.oxfam.org.au/world/emergencies/asia_tsunami.html).  It seems like the best thing that *anyone* could be doing with money right now.
