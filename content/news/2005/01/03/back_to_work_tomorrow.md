Tomorrow I'm back in the office, and back at work after my short Christmas/New Year break.  It'll be time to plough through that 45-email inbox, and see what else is waiting for me.

I've started converting the news item archive pages to the new template.  Expect more fiddling as I try to get them looking clearer.  (They seem a bit too *busy* right now.)  There are changes under the hood to commenting too: I now use the [TypeKey](http://typekey.com) registration for comments.  If you have a TypeKey identity, use it.  If not, you can either [sign up there](http://typekey.com), or wait for your comments to be vetted by me before they show up on the site.  This measure seems necessary to avoid all of the unsolicited comment spam this site has been suffering over the last months.  

Please let me know if anything isn't working for you.
