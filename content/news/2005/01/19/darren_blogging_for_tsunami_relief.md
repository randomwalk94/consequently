Our friend Darren Rowse is [blogging for tsunami relief](http://www.breakingnewsblog.com/blogathon/) over a 24 hour period.  To make things interesting for him, we're sponsoring him with a small amount for each different [top level domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_TLDs) he uses in a post.  It should make his posting nice and eclectic.
