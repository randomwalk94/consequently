This semester I am teaching the first-year subject [*Introduction to Formal Logic*](http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub) and an honours (fourth-year) seminar [*Logic and Philosophy*](http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161438/pub).  I'll teach the honours class from draft material from my (*as yet only in scribbles in my notebooks*) [draft book](http://consequently.org/writing/pc).
