Matt Carter and Nick Trakakis are [arguing over dialetheism](http://cogitation.braininavat.net/dialetheism.htm).  What's dialetheism?  It's the view that some contradictory pairs of statements are true.

It's interesting that Nick is trying the line that contradictions (conjunctions of the form '*p* and not-*p*') are *meaningless*.  I always find it hard to judge claims of meaninglessness (since I don't have on hand a general theory of meaningfulness), but I don't have a great deal of sympathy for that line of argument.  I would have thought that it was because we *understood* the meaning the statement '*p* and not-*p*' that we could see that it couldn't be true.  

But Nick's in good company here.  His view that contradictions (and tautologies) has proponents like the Wittgenstein of the [*Tractatus*](http://www.kfs.org/~jonathan/witt/tlph.html).
