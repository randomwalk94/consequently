The [wiki](http://consequently.org/edit/page) is lots of fun.  Being able to edit the page you're on, and freely create new pages by making new links, does seem to foster a new way of writing.  It'll be fun to see if any of my [students catch on](http://consequently.org/edit/page/161-438_in_2005).

If you're interested in typesetting manuscripts in LaTeX, you might be interested in the notes I wrote up this evening.  One on [page layout](http://consequently.org/edit/page/PnC_Page_Layout), and the other on [proof trees](http://consequently.org/edit/page/PnC_Example_prooftrees).  If you're interested in playing around on the [wiki](http://consequently.org/edit/page), feel free.  Start by looking at the recommendations on [how to participate](http://consequently.org/edit/page/How_To_Participate).
