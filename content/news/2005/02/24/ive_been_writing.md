I've been pretty busy getting courses up and running for Semester 1.  Some of this has involved <a href="http://consequently.org/writing/pc">starting writing my book</a>, and setting up a <a href="http://consequently.org/edit/page/Proof_and_Counterexample">wiki</a> as a place to encourage feedback on the book and other things.  Go and play there... (I'll be interested to see how this goes.)
