Tomorrow I'm presenting a [paper](http://consequently.org/writing/minitrue) at the staff seminar in the Philosophy Department at the University of Otago.   Given Charles Pigden's [delightful account of seminars at Otago](http://www.otago.ac.nz/philosophy/history.html#10), I'm not quite sure what to expect.  

Wish me luck!
