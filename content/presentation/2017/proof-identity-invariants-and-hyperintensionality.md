*Abstract*: This talk is a comparison of how different approaches to hyperintensionality, aboutness and subject matter treat (classically) logically equivalent statements. I compare and contrast two different notions of subject matter that might be thought to be representational or truth first -- *[Aboutness](https://www.amazon.com/Aboutness-Carl-G-Hempel-Lecture/dp/0691144958/consequentlyorg)* (Princeton University Press, 2014), and truthmakers conceived of as situations, as discussed in my “[Truthmakers, Entailment and Necessity](http://consequently.org/writing/ten/).” I contrast this with the kind of inferentialist account of hyperintensionality arising out of the *proof invariants* I have explored [in recent work](http://consequently.org/writing/proof-terms-for-classical-derivations/).

This is a talk presented at the [Hyperintensionality Afternoon](http://projects.illc.uva.nl/conceivability/Events/event/38/Hyperintensionality-proof-theory-and-semantics), held by Francesco Berto's project on the [Logic of Conceivability](http://projects.illc.uva.nl/conceivability/).
