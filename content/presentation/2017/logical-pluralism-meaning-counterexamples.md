*Abstract*: I attempt to give a *pluralist* and *syntax-independent* account of classical and constructive *proof*, grounded in univocal rules for evaluating assertions and denials for judgments featuring the logical connectives, interpretable as governing warrants *for* and *against* claims, and which results in an interpretation of classical and constructive counterexamples to invalid arguments.

This is a talk presented at the [Pluralisms Workshop](Logical Pluralism: Meaning, Rules and Counterexamples), hosted at the University of Bonn, March 2-4, 2017.
