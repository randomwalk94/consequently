This is a talk on proof theory for [Melbourne Logic Day](http://philevents.org/event/show/27034). 

Abstract: In this talk, I will explain how proof terms for derivations in classical propositional logic are invariants for derivations under a natural class of permutations of rules. The result is two independent characterisations of one underlying notion of proof identity.
