I'm giving a talk entitled “Terms for Classical Sequents: Proof Invariants and Strong Normalisation” at the [University of Gothenburg Logic Seminar](http://flov.gu.se/english/research/seminars/logic/), via Skype.

Abstract: A proof for a sequent \\(\Sigma\vdash\Delta\\) shows you how to get from the premises \\(\Sigma\\) to the conclusion \\(\Delta\\). It seems very plausible that some valid sequents have *different* proofs. It also seems plausible that some different derivations for the one sequent don't represent different proofs, but are merely different ways to present the *same* proof. These two plausible ideas are hard to make precise, especially in the case of classical logic. 

In this paper, I give a new account of a kind of invariant for derivations in the classical sequent calculus, and show how it can formalise a notion of proof identity with pleasing behaviour. In particular, it has a confluent, strongly normalising cut elimination procedure.
