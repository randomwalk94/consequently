I was originally scheduled to give a talk entitled “What Proofs are About” at the [*About Aboutness* Workshop](http://philevents.org/event/show/24086) at the University of Melbourne on Saturday, July 16, 2016, but my plane back to Melbourne was delayed and I didn't get to present the paper then.

So, I'm presenting it at the [Melbourne Logic Seminar](http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/logic-seminar/) instead. 

*Abstract*: This talk is a comparison of how three different approaches to subject matter treat some pairs of statements that say *different things* but are (classically) logically equivalent. The pairs are

1. \\(p\lor\neg p\\) and \\(\top\\)
2. \\(p\lor(p\land q)\\) and \\(p\\)
3. \\((p\lor\neg p)\lor(q\lor\neg q)\\) and \\((p\lor\neg p)\land(q\lor\neg q)\\).

I compare and contrast the notion of subject matter introduced in Stephen Yablo's *[Aboutness](https://www.amazon.com/Aboutness-Carl-G-Hempel-Lecture/dp/0691144958/consequentlyorg)* (Princeton University Press, 2014), truthmakers conceived of as situations, as discussed in my “[Truthmakers, Entailment and Necessity](http://consequently.org/writing/ten/),” and the *proof invariants* I have explored [in recent work](http://consequently.org/presentation/2016/terms-for-classical-sequents-aal-2016/).
