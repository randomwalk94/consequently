I am giving a talk, entitled "Generality and Existence 3: Substitution and Identity" in the [Melbourne Logic Workshop 2015](http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/2015/12/02/logic-workshop-2015/) at the [Melbourne Logic Group](http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/2015/12/02/logic-workshop-2015/). 

Abstract: In this talk, extend a sequent proof system for free logic to include an identity predicate. Or rather, *two* different candidate identity predicates allowing for the substitution of a lesser or greater class of predications. I show that the resulting system is well-behaved proof theoretically (the Cut rule is admissible) and the identity predicates can be well motivated in terms of their defining rules.
