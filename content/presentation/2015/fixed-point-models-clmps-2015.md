I'm giving a talk entitled “Fixed Point Models for Theories of Properties and Classes” at the first 2015 meeting of the [15th Congress on Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science](http://clmps.helsinki.fi), in Helsinki. 

Abstract: There is a vibrant (but minority) community among philosophical logicians seeking to resolve the paradoxes of classes, properties and truth by way of adopting some non-classical logic in which trivialising paradoxical arguments are not valid. There is also a long tradition in theoretical computer science—going back to Dana Scott's fixed point model of the lambda calculus—of constructions allowing for various fixed points. In this talk, I will bring these traditions closer together, to show how these model constructions can shed light on what we could hope for in a non-trivial model of a theory for classes, properties or truth featuring fixed points.
