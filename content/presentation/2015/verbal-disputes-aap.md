This is a talk at the [2015 Australasian Association for Philosophy Conference](http://www.aap-conferences.org.au) at Macquarie University in Sydney. I will attempt to be precise about the notion of a *merely verbal disagreement*, and explain how we can fix on the meaning of our logical constants can play a coordinating role in dialogue, and how (in a certain sense), it might be *impossible* to a have a merely verbal dispute concerning logical constants such as conjunction, negation, the quantifiers, and even---if you're careful---modal operators.
