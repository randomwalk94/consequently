This is a dry run for my [talk](http://consequently.org/presentation/2015/verbal-disputes-oxford/) at the [Oxford Workshop on Verbal Disputes](https://verbaldisputesoxford.wordpress.com). 

I will attempt to be precise about the notion of a *merely verbal disagreement*, and explain how we can fix on the meaning of our logical constants can play a coordinating role in dialogue, and how (in a certain sense), it might be *impossible* to a have a merely verbal dispute concerning logical constants such as conjunction, negation, the quantifiers, and even---if you're careful---modal operators.

If you'd like to attend, keep track [on the PhilEvents entry for the talk](http://philevents.org/event/show/17569).
