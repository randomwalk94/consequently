I'm giving a talk, entitled “Generality and Existence 1: Quantification and Free Logic” at a [Workshop on Inferentialism](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/arche/events/event?id=917), hosted by [Arché](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/arche/) at the University of St Andrews. 

Abstract: In this presentation, I motivate a cut free sequent calculus for classical logic with first order quantification, allowing for singular terms free of existential import. Along the way, I motivate a criterion for rules designed to answer Prior's question about what distinguishes rules for logical concepts, like *conjunction* from apparently similar rules for putative concepts like *tonk*, and I show that the rules for the quantifiers—and the existence predicate—satisfy that condition.
