A seminar at *[Melbourne Logic Day](http://philevents.org/event/show/14562)*, May 30, 2014.

I explain how the 'trace model' for relevant arithmetic (introduced [here](http://consequently.org/writing/mfsa/)) can be extended quite naturally to model a logic including a de Morgan negation. The result is not a model for the logic **R**, but for its weaker cousin, **TW**.
