A seminar at the workshop *[Algebra and Substructural Logic 5](https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/asubl5)* (La Trobe, December 2015).

I explain how the `trace model' for relevant arithmetic (introduced [here](http://consequently.org/writing/mfsa/)) can be extended quite naturally to model a logic including a de Morgan negation. The result is not a model for the logic **R**, but for its weaker cousin, **TW**.
